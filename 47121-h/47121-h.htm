      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>p to Queen Anne,
      this work is based upon Agnes Strickland's "Queens of England;" but
      subsequent to that period many authorities have been consulted, and only
      such matter used as would seem appropriate. My first care was to prepare a
      narrative which should interest young people, but I have endeavored also
      to produce a result that would prove a source, not only of pleasure, but
      of profit. The limits of the design make it evident that some eminent
      names and noteworthy events could receive slight mention, or none at all,
      and that politics could be introduced only when requisite for the
      comprehension of events that depended on them. It will be a satisfaction
      to hope that my readers may be prompted to independent inquiry.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>atilda, wife of
      the great William, the Conqueror, was an exceedingly handsome woman, and
      as she had received the best education that was possible in her times, she
      was as celebrated for her learning as for her beauty. She was, besides,
      generous and religious, and had all the qualities necessary for the
      position she was called upon to fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was famed for her fancy-work, which was looked upon as one of the most
      important and desirable occupations for ladies of rank; and any woman who
      could spin, weave and embroider was considered quite a treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matilda had three cousins who were such skilful needlewomen, that they
      were sought in marriage by the greatest princes of Europe. Their work has
      not been preserved, but Matilda's still remains and is called the Bayeux
      Tapestry. It is the most wonderful achievement in needlework ever
      accomplished by any woman. But we shall tell more about it, by-and-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matilda's father was Earl of Flanders, a rich, powerful prince, skilled in
      the arts of peace and war. He was, besides, such a popular man that all
      the rulers in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="link016" id="link016">016</a></span>
      neighborhood were anxious to win the hand of his beautiful daughter.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Her cousin, William of Normandy, was the most accomplished of them all,
      and loved her devotedly. He was handsome, brave and talented, and so
      strong, that, it is said, no man could bend his bow but himself. And he
      was such a sure marksman, that even when riding at full speed, he seldom
      missed his aim. It is remarkable that although he was the tallest man in
      his army, he passed through all his battles without the loss of a drop of
      blood, until towards the close of his career, when he was wounded by his
      own son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, this young man did not find favor in the eyes of his lady
      cousin at all; this mortified him so much, that he resolved to win her in
      spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a rival in a young Saxon nobleman named Brihtric Meaw, who had come
      to Flanders as ambassador from Edward the Confessor, then on the British
      throne. This favored gentleman was so fair and light-haired that he was
      nicknamed "Snow." Matilda loved him in secret, which is probably the
      reason why she would not listen to her cousin William. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link017" id="link017">017</a></span> But Brihtric
      Meaw does not seem to have cared particularly for her, and so did not find
      out what her sentiments were towards him. Thus, quite innocently, he never
      attempted to court her, and she could not forgive his indifference. Still
      her mind was filled with him, and this made her treat William coldly. He
      was not to be baffled, however, but courted her through seven long and
      tedious years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he became impatient, so one day when Matilda was going home from
      church, he managed to meet her, as lovers will. Perhaps she was more
      unkind to him than usual and made him angry, otherwise I do not know how
      to account for his behavior on that occasion, but he seized hold of her,
      rolled her in the dirt, then actually beat her. Before she had time to
      call for help, after she had recovered from her surprise, he jumped on his
      horse, and rode off as fast as he could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, she might have been induced to forgive him for spoiling her good
      clothes, but how she could have had anything more to do with a fellow, no
      matter what his rank might be, who could dare to treat her so brutally, is
      hard to understand. Perhaps the women were not so high spirited then as
      they are now, but certain it is that instead of getting into a rage,
      stamping her feet and forbidding him ever to approach her again, the
      princess was won. This remarkable style of love-making went straight to
      her heart, and brought matters to a crisis. It may be that she feared
      another beating, or that she was finally convinced of the greatness of his
      love; whatever it was, she consented to become his wife, forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was celebrated at William's Castle in Normandy, Matilda having
      gone there accompanied by her parents, and a large retinue of ladies and
      gentlemen. Her trousseau was magnificent, and on her wedding day she wore
      a superb velvet robe embroidered with gold and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link018" id="link018">018</a></span> pearls. It was so rich and
      costly, that it was for a long time preserved in the treasury of the
      Cathedral of Bayeux with William's mantle and helmet, which were adorned
      with precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of his marriage, William's affairs were in a most perilous
      condition, for he was surrounded by powerful neighbors who wanted to get
      possession of the rich fields of Normandy. They hoped to divide them among
      themselves and leave the duke nothing. He had enemies among his own
      subjects too, who would have been pleased to turn him off and have his
      cousin Guy of Burgundy to govern them, because they thought he had a
      better right to the dukedom of Normandy than William had. Perhaps this was
      so, but the latter had too determined a will to yield, and he had been a
      leader nearly all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was only five years old, he formed a battalion of boys of his own
      age whom he drilled in military practice every day. It must have been a
      pretty sight, and no doubt the little fellows fancied themselves real
      warriors. Of course disputes arose, all of which William settled with
      remarkable skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a good student too, for he knew enough of Latin at eight years of
      age, to read and explain Caesar's Commentaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was about seven, his father, Duke Robert, went on a pilgrimage to
      the Holy Land. But before he did so, he assembled all the nobles of his
      realm, and made them swear fealty to his bright, promising child, whom he
      hugged and kissed tenderly, then presented to his subjects as their future
      Sovereign, saying: "He is little, but he will grow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this, Henry, King of France, invaded William's dominion,
      but he was defeated, because the young duke had such excellent advisers
      and assistants. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link020" id="link020">020</a></span>

      king was so indignant at this defeat, that he incited the Norman nobles to
      stir up an insurrection, hoping, no doubt, to punish the boy by depriving
      him of his title, altogether.

    <p>
      Once when William was out hunting, he passed the night at a remote castle
      without military escort. His cousin, Guy of Burgundy, hearing of it, laid
      a plot to kill him, but this was prevented by the Court fool, who
      accidentally found it out and travelled all night, at full speed, to warn
      the Duke of his danger. He managed to get into the castle at four o'clock
      in the morning, and knocked violently on William's chamber door with the
      handle of his whip, shouting: "get up! get up, my lord!" William obeyed
      the summons, and mounting his swiftest horse, half dressed, rode with
      fiery speed for many hours before he was beyond danger. Even while making
      his escape, he might have been caught, for his horse was almost exhausted
      when he had the good fortune to meet a gentleman who supplied him with
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, the young duke had a chance to turn the tables on his cousin, Guy,
      whom he captured in battle. But remembering that they had been friends in
      early childhood, William forgave the attempt his cousin had made on his
      life, and released him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of France was just planning another attack on William's dominions
      when the young man married, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="link022"
      id="link022">022</a></span>then Matilda's father became such a powerful
      ally that the king hesitated. Soon after he died. Relieved of this
      anxiety, the duke thought he might settle down and enjoy the society of
      his young wife; but, the Archbishop of Rouen, who had reasons of his own
      for trying to prevent the marriage, pronounced it unlawful, and the young
      couple were so distressed that they appealed to the Pope. He decided that
      if each would build and endow an Abbey, as well as a hospital for the
      blind, he would grant them dispensation. This was not difficult, so
      Matilda founded the Holy Trinity for Nuns, and William founded the
      Monastery of St. Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then William set to work to erect a palace for his own dwelling very near
      the Monastery. Matilda had a great taste for architecture and took
      pleasure in superintending these buildings. The great hall of the palace
      was one of the finest apartments in all Europe and the edifice itself was
      superb.
    </p>
    <p>
      This royal couple did everything to render their subjects happy and
      contented, and provided work for them by building ships and harbors, which
      promoted trade also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though we know that Matilda did not love her husband before marriage, she
      became a devoted wife afterwards, and William showed his entire confidence
      in her by leaving her to govern his country when he went over to England
      to obtain a promise from Edward the Confessor that he would adopt him as
      successor to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was kindly received in England, and Edward gave him some fine hawks,
      hounds and other presents. Then Matilda had a little boy whose birth added
      considerably to her happiness. He was called Robert, after his grandpapa,
      and there was great rejoicing in Normandy over this event. If they could
      have foreseen how he would turn out, the feeling would have been very
      different. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link023" id="link023">023</a></span>In
      course of time Matilda had eight other children, and during many years of
      peace and national prosperity, she and her husband devoted themselves to
      their care and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1065.</span> Now it happened that once, when
      Harold, Edward the Confessor's half brother, was out fishing in an open
      boat, he was overtaken by a storm and obliged to seek refuge in the
      territory of the Earl of Ponthieu, who seized him and shut him up in
      prison. William rescued him, treated him most kindly, and even promised
      him one of his daughters in marriage, though she was but seven years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="figright" style="width:30%;">
      <img src="images/8027.jpg" alt="8027 " width="100%" /><br /><a
      href="images/8027.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Harold acted like a sneak, and pretended to be highly flattered; but it
      was not his intention ever to marry the girl at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to William's narration of how Edward had adopted him as his
      successor to the British throne, and made a solemn promise to assist him
      to get it. Soon after his return to England, he married the widow of the
      Prince of Wales, and at Edward's death he took no notice of his promise to
      William, but had himself proclaimed king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course such conduct aroused William's wrath, and, with the aid of his
      wife's relations, he resolved to invade England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1066.</span> This was the year 1066, and a
      memorable <span class="pagenum"><a name="link024" id="link024">024</a></span>one
      on account of the appearance in the heavens of a splendid three-tailed
      comet. We are pleased to have such a visitor and to be able to gaze at it
      and study it with the aid of telescopes, but in that time the people were
      so superstitious that they thought it portended evil, and so it spread
      terror throughout the land. The death of the King, which occurred only a
      few days after its appearance, served to encourage the superstition. When
      the astrologers foretold its approach they announced it thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "In the year one thousand and sixty-six,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Comets to England's sons an end shall fix."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the largest and finest pieces of handiwork that Matilda
      accomplished, was the tapestry representing this comet in the heavens with
      its three fiery tails spread all across the canvas. A group of
      terror-stricken Saxon princes, priests and ladies have rushed out of their
      dwellings to look at it, and are pointing towards it, their faces
      expressing the utmost anxiety. To be sure the comet looked, when compared
      with the objects in the picture, a great deal larger than it could
      possibly have been, but probably, the size was suggested by the awe it
      inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matilda did not do all this work alone; if she had, Hood's Song of the
      Shirt might well apply to the hundreds and thousands of cross stitches
      that she would have made, and we should pity her for having such a weary
      task. But she was assisted by all the ladies of her court, who laughed and
      chatted merrily while their hands were busily employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, William started on his expedition to England, leaving his wife to
      rule at home, and his son Robert, then only thirteen years of age,
      military chief of Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large number of his subjects objected to this invasion, SO when the
      whole fleet was becalmed at St. Valleri, the

      soldiers complained and declared that God was their adversary, and had
      stopped the wind to keep them back. The king did not know what to say to
      this, but at last he hit upon something that he knew would impress them.
      He ordered the shrine of St. Valleri to be brought from the tomb and
      placed in an open field, then invited everybody to pray to the saint to
      intercede with the Almighty for a breeze. Crowds of people far and near,
      as well as the Norman soldiers, brought offerings, and in a short time the
      shrine was buried in the gold, silver and other precious gifts that they
      placed upon it. The wind did not immediately change, but the malcontents
      had something to think about, and the delay gave Matilda time to carry out
      a pleasant surprise that she had planned for her husband. One day she
      appeared in the harbor on a splendid vessel of war that she had caused to
      be built as a present for William. She called it the Mora. At the prow of
      the vessel was a gold image of their youngest son. With one hand he held a
      trumpet to his lips, and with the other a bow with the arrow aimed towards
      England. Loud cheering and joyful exclamations greeted Matilda's
      appearance, and her husband was overcome by this mark of her affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mora carried a red flag at her mast-head by day; it was replaced at
      night by a bright light that served as a guide for the other vessels of
      the fleet. Scarcely was the duke well established on board than the long
      wished-for wind arose, every man was summoned to his post, and they set
      sail. Matilda went back home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Norman fleet met some very rough weather and lost two of their ships.
      On the 28th of September, 1066, they landed on the coast of Sussex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke was the last person to step on shore. As he did so, he stumbled
      and fell. Probably he was still giddy <span class="pagenum"><a

      but his followers thought it an evil omen and raised a great cry of
      distress. The duke's presence of mind did not desert him. He picked up two
      handfuls of sand, exclaiming: "See, Seigneurs! by the splendor of God, I
      have seized England with both hands!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a meal was served on the beach, and afterwards the soldiers having
      selected a spot, began to put up the wooden fortress that they had brought
      in sections, from Normandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A piece of Matilda's tapestry represents the soldiers, assisting the
      carpenters and builders in this work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The army tarried four days on the beach. But there were no telegraphs or
      newspapers in those days, so Harold knew nothing of the approach of his
      enemy until a knight arrived from Sussex, having ridden all the way
      without food or rest, and rushing into his presence shouted at the top of
      his voice: "The Normans have come! they have landed at Hastings and built
      up a fort! they will rend the land from thee and thine unless thou defend
      it well!" Harold sent a messenger offering to buy off the Normans, but
      William replied that he had not come for money, but to claim the realm
      that Edward the Confessor had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay; you ask too much of us, Sire," said the messenger. "Harold is
      willing to purchase your departure with silver, gold and fine garments,
      but if you refuse, he will give you battle on Saturday night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke accepted the challenge. The night preceding the battle was passed
      by the English in dancing, singing and gambling; but the Normans prayed,
      fasted, and confessed their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle was fought seven miles from Hastings. Taillefer, the warrior
      minstrel of Normandy, rode gallantly <span class="pagenum"><a

      William had three horses killed under him that day without receiving a
      single scratch himself. Harold was killed, and the victorious Duke William
      pitched his tent on the battle-field that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Matilda received the joyful tidings of her husband's triumph, she was
      praying in a church, which, she ordered to be forever after called Notre
      Dame de Bonnes Nouvelles, in memory of the good news she had received
      there.

      A celebrated piece of embroidery made by her after the victory represents

      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A.D. 1066.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span> n the Monday
      following the battle of Hastings, William rode into the city of London, on
      horseback, followed by a long train of the nobility of England and
      Normandy. He proceeded to Westminster Abbey, where he was crowned King of
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grand preparations had been made for this event, and such a brilliant
      coronation had never been seen. Crowds of people gathered in the streets,
      and the duke's fine presence and noble bearing won all hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding the crown aloft the archbishop asked the nobles assembled, if they
      were willing to receive this duke for their king. They were so boisterous
      in their eager assent, that the Norman soldiers who had assembled outside
      the Abbey in case their protection should be needed, mistook the noise for
      the rising of the Saxons, and set fire to most of the buildings in the
      neighborhood. It required prompt action on the part of the more
      sober-minded of the Normans, to prevent the flames from destroying the
      Abbey itself. William was dismayed at this occurrence, and it was not
      until he showed himself in his coronation robes and crown, that his
      followers could be restored to order and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, one would naturally suppose that in those rude times, Matilda's
      neighbors would have taken advantage of her husband's absence to invade
      her dominion, but she governed with so much skill and prudence that they
      did <span class="pagenum"><a name="link033" id="link033">033</a></span>not
      venture to molest her, and she made herself universally beloved and
      respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having recounted the good traits of this queen, it is only fair to present
      the bad ones too, because nobody is entirely without faults, yet it is
      painful to be obliged to refer to one very dark deed of which she was
      guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011"> </a>
    </p>

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      She must have had a large share of vanity, for she never forgave Brihtric
      Meaw because he did not return her early affection, and fourteen years
      later she sought revenge in this wise: She persuaded her husband to
      deprive Meaw of all his lands and bestow them on her; then she had him put
      in prison where, after several months, he died. This was a very serious
      crime, and it is hard to understand how a woman with everything in the
      world to make her <span class="pagenum"><a name="link034" id="link034">034</a></span>happy,
      and with qualities so fine and noble as Matilda's certainly were, could
      have been capable of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an absence of six months, William returned to Normandy, accompanied
      by a number of Saxon noblemen. He brought a large quantity of costly
      spoils, among which were garments richly embroidered in silver and gold by
      the skilful hands of the Anglo-Saxon women, whose beautiful work was
      renowned all over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole summer was spent by the royal couple in travelling and
      amusements until news was brought to William that his Saxon subjects were
      planning an insurrection, when he hastened back to England. He arrived
      before any very serious steps had been taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now began to see that his position would be in every respect more
      agreeable, and his subjects would be better, satisfied if he had his
      family at court, so he sent a numerous company over to Normandy to conduct
      them to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1068.</span> They proceeded at once to Winchester,
      where the queen's coronation took place with great pomp and ceremony. In
      order to render it still more imposing, William had himself crowned a
      second time, but on this occasion there was no such excitement as
      disturbed the first crowning. Everybody was charmed with the graceful,
      majestic appearance of the new queen, though some of the Saxons objected
      to her being called Regina, which is the Latin word, signifying Queen.
      However, William insisted upon this honor being conferred on his wife;
      though previous to his reign all the wives of the various kings had simply
      been termed "the lady, his companion." To be sure, few of the queens of
      England could claim more illustrious descent than Matilda; for Alfred, the
      best and noblest of their sovereigns, was one of her ancestors, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link035" id="link035">035</a></span>she was
      connected with most of the royal families in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the coronation ceremony, a grand banquet was served, at which both
      the king and queen presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Matilda had to be served by her hew subjects, the English, because
      they would not have been satisfied if she had kept only her Norman ladies
      in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was so happy that he bestowed favors right and left in order to
      gain the affection of the nation. He also revived some of the old offices
      at court, which was a very popular act. Among these, was that of grand
      pannetier, whose duty it was to carry the salt and the carving-knives from
      the pantry to the king's dining-table on state occasions. His fees were
      the salt-cellars, spoons, knives, and bread-covers laid on the royal
      table. Forks were not among the luxuries of William the Conqueror's day,
      when people must have verified the proverb of later times, that "fingers
      were made before forks." The Manor of Addington was presented to the cook
      for preparing a kind of white soup that tickled his majesty's palate.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the grand coronation banquet, a noble cavalier, named Marmion, rode
      into the hall on horseback, completely armed, and shouted out three times:
      "If anybody denies that our most gracious sovereign Lord William, and his
      spouse Matilda, are King and Queen of England, he is a false-hearted
      traitor and liar, and here I do challenge him to single combat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody accepted the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under a glass case' at the Museum of Bayeux is preserved to this very day,
      a piece of canvas, nineteen inches broad and sixty-seven yards long, on
      which Queen Matilda embroidered the whole conquest of England by her
      husband. There are many hundred figures of men, horses, birds, beasts,
      houses, trees, castles, and churches, all done <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link036" id="link036">036</a></span>in their proper colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The designs were made by a dwarf artist named Turold, who seems to have
      been farsighted enough to know that the work would become celebrated, for
      he has curiously managed to introduce his own figure or name on the canvas
      wherever it was possible.

    <p>
      After William and his wife were seated on the throne, there was a season
      of tranquillity. Then the Conqueror laid the foundation for the great
      Tower of London, as well as other strong fortresses. But revolts began
      again, and the Normans demanded the return of Matilda. She resolved to
      gratify them, but in so doing displeased the English, for they knew that
      during her absence there would be fewer celebrations at court, and they
      would thus be deprived of opportunities for disposing of their fine goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1069.</span> All the working people were affected,
      more or less, by her departure, and they <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link037" id="link037">037</a></span>got into a habit of gathering at
      each other's houses to discuss their wrongs and grievances. Fearing that
      they might stimulate one another to revolt, William instituted the Curfew,
      or the tolling of a bell, at eight o'clock every evening. This was a
      signal for all the lights and fires to be put out in the dwellings; the
      word was originally <i>couvre feu</i>, which means extinguishing fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0013" id="linkimage-0013"> </a>

      href="images/8041.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </div>
    <p>
      Then William made war in the north of England and laid waste the whole
      country. In one of the battles a fair young Saxon, who was engaged to one
      of the king's daughters, was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, Norman customs were adopted in England, and that dialect,
      which was a mixture of French and Danish, became popular. The learned
      wrote and conversed in Latin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the ladies of Normandy, whose husbands were fighting William's
      battles, began to grow tired of the long separation; besides, certain bits
      of gossip that came over the water to them aroused their jealousy. So,
      many of them insisted on recalling their lords who, for the sake of peace,
      were obliged to desert the king, and obey. The queen herself set a very
      bad example, for growing jealous of a daughter of one of the priests, she
      actually had the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link038" id="link038">038</a></span>poor
      girl secretly put to death. When William went to Normandy, he beat her
      severely for this shameful deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such treatment does not seem to have surprised her very much, though, for
      she forgave him just as she did for a similar indignity before her
      marriage, and the royal couple were soon living on the most amicable terms
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one serious cause of disagreement between them. It was the
      great affection that the queen felt for her eldest son Robert. She loved
      him better than any of her other children, while the third son, William
      Rufus, was the king's favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert was a proud, self-willed, quick-tempered lad, who always wanted to
      rule, and the position of trust and importance that he had filled in
      Normandy during his father's absence had encouraged this disposition. He
      was spoiled, and showed an inclination to rebel when William resumed the
      reins of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1076.</span> One day when he was walking with some
      companions around the castle, his two younger brothers, William Rufus and
      Richard, with a desire for boyish fun, threw some dirty water out of the
      window directly on his head. Instead of receiving the joke good-naturedly,
      or retaliating as any brother might be expected to do, Robert flew into a
      passion, and with a drawn sword in his hand rushed up-stairs, declaring
      that he would kill the offenders. A great tumult ensued, and it was only
      the appearance of their father who burst into the room, flourishing his
      sword, and pronouncing angry threats, that prevented fatal consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Robert privately withdrew from court with a party of young
      nobles who were attached to him. He stood upon his dignity and refused to
      bow to his father's will.

      this time the Princess Constance married, and shortly after Princess
      Cicely entered a convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the queen received a severe blow in the death of her second son,
      Richard, a prince of most amiable disposition and studious habits. But
      Robert's bad conduct and his disrespectful behavior towards his father
      gave her more real sorrow than anything else in the world.

    <p>
      After a short absence he sought the king's presence and made a request
      that he should be appointed Sovereign of Normandy, saying, "It is my
      right; have you not promised to bestow it on me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not my custom to strip until I go to bed," replied the king, adding
      some wholesome advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Robert, becoming impertinent,' said he did not come to listen to
      sermons, and angrily withdrew. He immediately went to live with his uncle,
      the Earl of Flanders. There he lived such a wild, extravagant life that
      his mother was frequently called upon to supply him with extra funds. When
      her private purse was empty, she sold her jewels and even her garments to
      provide the wicked youth with what he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was kept secret from William, which was certainly very wrong. But
      he found it out at last, and it need scarcely be said, that he was
      exceedingly angry. However, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link042"
      id="link042">042</a></span>he did not beat his wife this time; perhaps he
      had heard before of women making sacrifices for their children, but he was
      hurt at Matilda's lack of confidence in him, and told her very truly, "The
      woman who deceives her husband is the destruction of her own house." She
      defended herself so well, that he forgave her at last, and continued to
      love her till the very end of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somebody had to be punished, and the victim was the agent who had
      forwarded the money to Robert, and attended to the selling of the queen's
      jewels and garments. The poor man was condemned to have his eyes put out.
      Filled with terror, he ran to a monastery, where, within twenty-four hours
      he was shaven and shorn and became a professed monk. Thus was he
      protected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert's ambition would not let him rest, so he prepared an attack on
      England. There was a furious battle, and it so happened, that in the midst
      of it a hand to hand encounter took place between father and son. William
      was run through the arm with his adversary's lance and unhorsed. It is to
      be hoped, that as the warriors wore their visors down they did not
      recognize each other, for it would be horrible to think of a father's
      being intentionally wounded by his own flesh and blood. He cried out so
      loudly that he was known at once; then Robert raised him tenderly from the
      ground and begged to be forgiven, while he placed the wounded king on his
      own horse and led him to a place of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time after the battle, in which Robert came off victorious,
      before he was blessed with his father's forgiveness, and this was brought
      about by the over-fond mother. Her health had suffered so much on account
      of the constant anxiety to which she was subjected, that William granted
      her request to invite his erring son home. But Robert was never admitted
      to his father's confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1078.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link043" id="link043">043</a></span>It was William the Conqueror who
      established the celebrated Doomsday Book which contained a survey of all
      the lands throughout England. The object of this book was to enable the
      sovereign so to regulate taxes as to feel sure that he received as much as
      he dared exact from each subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while her husband was making one of his expeditions to Normandy
      that Queen Matilda heard of a German hermit who was renowned for his gift
      of prophecy. She sent to consult him as to what was likely to be the
      result of the ill feeling existing between her husband and Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit required three days for his reply, which was: "Tell your
      mistress that the Most High has made known to me in a dream, what she
      desires to hear. I saw in my vision, a pasture covered with grass and
      flowers. A noble charger was feeding thereon. A numerous herd gathered
      near eager to share the feast, but the charger would not permit them to
      approach. But, alas! suddenly he dropped dead, and a poor silly steer
      appeared in his place. He had no power to keep off the meaner animals, so
      they all rushed into the field and trampled down the grass and flowers
      that they failed to devour. This is the explanation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The noble steed is William the Conqueror, who by his wisdom and power
      keeps his surrounding foes in awe. The dull beast is Robert, who will
      succeed him. The other animals are the envious princes who are waiting for
      an opportunity to attack the fields of Normandy, and destroy the land. If
      the illustrious lady do not labor to restore peace, there will be nothing
      but misery, ruin, and desolation to her beloved country." This message
      came close upon the death of the Princess Constance, and added so much to
      Matilda's sorrow that her health broke down, and she died. She had reigned
      seventeen years, and was the first Anglo-Norman Queen of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matilda's funeral was conducted with great pomp, and the tomb that was
      placed over her grave was a mass of sculpture and precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king mourned the loss of his noble companion for many days; he gave up
      all his favorite sports and became an irritable, melancholy man. He
      survived his wife only four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Robert got possession of Normandy, but his attempt to place himself
      on the throne of England shortly afterwards failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1087.</span> William Rufus, called the Red King on
      account of the color of his hair, succeeded William the Conqueror, and his
      brother Henry became king when he died. Robert ended his life in a prison,
      after being shut up in it for twenty-eight years.

      CHAPTER III. MATILDA OF SCOTLAND, QUEEN OF HENRY I.
    </h2>

      A.D. 1077-1118.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his princess is
      called "The Good Queen," a title that shows how dear she must have been to
      her subjects, and how much she must have done to promote their happiness.
      She is the only princess of Scotland who ever shared the throne of an
      English king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt, Christina Atheling, was Abbess of Rumsey, and did all she could
      to influence Matilda to take the veil and enter a convent. But this was
      very displeasing to her father, the King of Scotland, and one day when she
      entered his presence with a nun's veil fastened to her head, he
      indignantly tore it to pieces, saying that he intended her to become a
      wife some day, not a nun. This circumstance made such an impression on her
      youthful mind, that she never forgot it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the king made this remark, there was a young man present whose name
      was Alan, Duke of Bretagne. He was the widower of Constance, William the
      Conqueror's daughter, consequently much too old for Matilda; nevertheless,
      he made up his mind on the spot that he would make her his wife if he
      could get her consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we must tell something about the illustrious mother of this
      princess, to whom she was indebted for her earliest lessons in piety and
      virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name was Margaret, and her parents were Edward Atheling, surnamed the
      Outlaw, and a daughter of Henry II. of Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1068.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link046" id="link046">046</a></span>When she was a young lady, her
      family determined to leave England and take up their residence in Hungary,
      but the ship on which they embarked became disabled, and was driven by a
      storm into the Frith of Forth. Malcolm Canmore, who was King of Scotland,
      chanced to be present when they arrived, and so struck was he with the
      extreme beauty of the Lady Margaret, that a few days later he demanded her
      hand in marriage. This offer pleased her brother Edgar Atheling very much,
      because, not only was it a fine thing to have his sister in such a lofty
      position, but Malcolm had received them all so kindly and hospitably that
      he had made an excellent impression, so Edgar joyfully gave his consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot where Margaret first set foot on Scottish soil is to this day
      called Queen's Ferry in memory of the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Malcolm could neither read nor write, and he was so rough and wild,
      that many of her Saxon friends objected to so pure and intellectual a girl
      as Margaret uniting herself to him. She loved him, however, and
      immediately after her marriage she set to work to reform her household as
      well as she could, and to introduce religious ceremonies, which were sadly
      wanting..
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband felt her superiority, and had so much confidence in her
      judgment that he left the entire control of the royal household in her
      hands. He entertained such respect and admiration for her virtues as well
      as her mental qualities, that her influence over him was excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      All persons who were leading bad, immoral lives were dismissed from the
      court, and no one was allowed to hold an office of any kind who failed in
      honesty or sobriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although grace was said daily after each meal, by Turgot, the court
      chaplain, the Scotch nobles were in the habit of leaving the table as soon
      as they had satisfied their

      without waiting for the grace. This displeased Margaret, and she began to
      consider what she could do to keep them in their seats without commanding
      them to stay. At last her woman's ingenuity fixed upon this arrangement.
      She ordered a cup of the very choicest wine in the royal cellar to be
      served to each man after grace, and by degrees she had the satisfaction of
      seeing not a single vacant chair at table so long as Turgot remained. In
      time the "grace cup" became an established custom not only at court, but
      in the castles of the nobility, and the dwellings of the humbler classes
      throughout the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was also a devoted mother, and bestowed a great deal of care upon
      the education of her seven children. The learned Turgot was their
      preceptor and confessor, and when the queen was dying she said to him:
      "Farewell! my life is drawing to a close; to you I commit the care of my
      children; teach them above all things to love and fear God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had been killed by treachery a short time previously, so the
      five princes and two princesses were left orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their uncle Edgar was very kind to them all, and placed the girls, Matilda
      and Mary, at the convent, with their aunt Christina, where he knew that
      they would have a better training and education than he could possibly
      bestow on them. There they remained for a long time, and were carefully
      instructed in the art of reading as well as in good manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christina always hoped that they would both become nuns, and considering
      that they were entirely under her influence, with no parents, their
      brothers at a distance, and no home but the convent, it seems strange that
      they did not. But they were reserved for another fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those rude times the Norman nobles were so rough <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link050" id="link050">050</a></span>and uncultivated that they had
      no respect for any woman excepting those consecrated to religion,
      consequently it was a common custom for young girls to dress in nun's
      attire for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Christina made her nieces wear the great, thick, heavy, black veil
      because it was all settled in her mind that it was to be forever, and
      whenever she saw Matilda without hers, she scolded her and treated her
      very harshly. Poor Matilda found it so uncomfortable, and no doubt
      unbecoming too, that she wept many a bitter tear over the infliction, and
      the moment she was out of her stern aunt's sight, she would fling the veil
      on the ground and stamp upon it. During the seven long years that she
      spent in the dreary convent, she must, many a time, have wished for her
      dear father to relieve her, as he once did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matilda was passionately fond of music and devoted much time and attention
      to this art. When she became Queen of England she was exceedingly liberal
      in her rewards to those monks who sang the church service well, and did
      everything in her power to encourage them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at the convent, this princess received two offers of marriage. The
      first was from the Alan, to whom we referred at the beginning of this
      biography. But fortunately for her he died before she was called upon to
      give an answer, for she positively asserted that she would rather wear the
      odious veil forever than wed him. The other offer was from the young and
      handsome William Warren, Earl of Surrey. But him she did not love, and
      although he was one of the richest and most powerful of the baronets of
      England or Normandy, she refused him. She was somewhat sly on this
      occasion, for she pleaded her devotion to a religious life as excuse,
      though the real one was the affection she entertained for Henry, fourth
      son of William the Conqueror.

      then at Wilton Abbey, near Winchester, the favorite home of the Norman
      king. Edgar Atheling, who was very fond of his niece, went frequently to
      see her, and Henry sometimes accompanied him. On such occasions it is
      probable that Matilda managed to leave off her veil, for she was too
      pretty not to be somewhat vain, and Henry was too young and ardent not to
      have his heart touched by her charms.

    <p>
      This prince was surnamed Beauclerc because he was such a good student, and
      Matilda was so well, educated herself that she could appreciate his
      intellect and accomplishments. Therefore she preferred him to Warren, and
      no doubt by a whispered word, or a sly glance, succeeded in letting him
      know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all William the Conqueror's sons, Henry was most in favor among the
      English, owing to his having been born on their soil: nevertheless it was
      a long time before he became king.
    </p>
    <p>
      When on his deathbed, his father called Henry to him and made the
      following prophecy: "Thy elder brothers may go before thee. Robert shall
      have Normandy, and William shall have England, but thou shalt be inheritor
      of all my honors, and shalt excel both thy brethren in riches and power."
    </p>
    <p>
      This dying prophecy was not fulfilled until he was thirty-two years old,
      when Wat Tyrrel's arrow placed him on the throne. It happened in this way:
      William Rufus, with his brother Henry and a large party of attendants,
      were hunting one day, when Henry, by some mistake, was separated from the
      others and found himself quite alone in an adjoining forest. Suddenly, the
      string of his cross-bow <span class="pagenum"><a name="link054"
      id="link054">054</a></span>snapped, and he entered the hut of the nearest
      forester to have it mended.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shrivelled-up old woman, who sat on the hearth-stone and looked like one
      of the witches in Macbeth, saluted him as king. He was very much surprised
      at this, and began to assure her that she had made a mistake. Without
      heeding his reply, she continued in a cracked voice, holding up her long,
      bony forefinger in token of warning,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      "Hasty news to thee I bring,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Henry, thou art now a king;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Mark the words and heed them well,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Which to thee in sooth I tell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And recall them in the hour
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Of thy regal state and power."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was amazed, but had no time to reply before the Red King's
      attendants surrounded the door of the hut with news that their Sovereign
      had been shot and instantly killed. Wat Tyrrel's arrow had accidentally
      struck him in the head, and the unlucky marksman had fled to escape
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Henry did not wait to weep over the sad fate of his brother, nor
      even to see his body properly cared for, but jumped into the saddle and
      made speed for Winchester. The cause of this haste was that the royal
      treasurer, who happened to be present at the chase, declared emphatically
      that the crown now belonged to Robert, and started on a race with Henry to
      announce it at the Norman palace. But Robert was in the Holy Land, so,
      with drawn sword, Henry forced the treasurer to give up his keys, and at
      once took possession of the royal robes, jewels, and regalia. This
      high-handed action caused dissatisfaction among those nobles who owned
      lands in Normandy, for they were desirous that their duke should succeed;
      so it was resolved to settle the question in the council chamber. All the

      and prelates assembled, and while they were debating the matter, Henry
      gathered a crowd about him in the street, and eloquently pleaded his own
      cause. First he reminded them that he was a born Englishman, then he made
      the most flattering promises, and concluded his speech by assuring them
      that they should have an English queen, and be governed by English laws.
      Loud shouts and hurrahs greeted his ears, and "Long live Henry, King of
      England!" passed from mouth to mouth, until it was taken up in the council
      hall itself, and thus, by the voice of the people was the succession
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day after this scene Henry was crowned at Westminster Abbey. The
      promises he made he fully intended to execute, and set about his work of
      reform without delay. His popularity increased, and when he made known his
      intention to marry Matilda, a descendant of their beloved King Alfred, and
      a girl educated in England, it met with great favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then made a formal proposal for her to her brother, the King of
      Scotland. But the Abbess Christina was determined not to give her up
      without a struggle, moreover, she was a Saxon, and objected to having the
      Norman line strengthened by such a union, so she declared that Matilda was
      a consecrated nun, whom it would be a sacrilege to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry did not dare to act in defiance of the church, though he had
      resolved on this marriage, so he wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury
      asking advice. That prelate refused to decide so important a question
      alone, but summoned a council of churchmen, before whom Matilda was
      requested to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This must have been a most embarrassing ordeal for a young girl brought up
      in the strict seclusion of a convent, but she was equal to it, and
      answered all the questions <span class="pagenum"><a name="link058"
      id="link058">058</a></span>put to her clearly and intelligibly. They asked
      her whether she had taken any vows, saying that if so, no motive could
      induce them to consent to their being broken. The princess denied that she
      had ever done so. The archbishop asked her if she had not worn the black
      veil at her father's court, and subsequently in the nunneries of Rumsey
      and Wilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not deny," she replied, "having worn the veil in my father's court,
      for when I was a child my aunt Christina put a piece of black cloth over
      my head; but when my father saw it, he snatched it off in great rage, and
      swore at the person who had put it on me, observing at the same time that
      it was his intention to give me in marriage, not to devote me to the
      church."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she told how she had worn the veil for protection at first, and
      afterwards, because her aunt would beat and scold her whenever she left it
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      This explanation was considered perfectly satisfactory, and the council
      pronounced Matilda free to contract marriage with the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although she loved Henry, and certainly had no desire to remain
      longer in the convent, yet she hesitated about getting married because she
      had heard the king was not so good and virtuous as he ought to be, and she
      feared to trust her happiness in his keeping. But those connected with the
      Saxon royal line entreated her with these words: "O most noble and most
      gracious of women, if thou wouldst, thou couldst raise up the ancient
      honor of England, thou wouldst be a pledge of reconciliation; but if thou
      refusest, the enmity between the Saxon and Norman races will be eternal;
      human blood will never cease to flow."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a strong argument in favor of her marriage. She was to become a
      bond of peace to a divided nation,

      ceased to object when Henry promised to be a constitutional monarch, and
      observe the laws and privileges established by Alfred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years and six months after his coronation Henry and Matilda were
      married, and the latter was crowned at Westminster. Before performing the
      ceremony, the archbishop stood up in the pulpit, and related the whole
      history of the princess's life, because he wanted to leave no room for
      doubt that she was justified in getting married. He then asked in a loud
      tone whether anybody present had an objection to raise. All declared that
      the matter was rightly settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This marriage proved one of the happiest events for the English nation,
      for the queen's thoughts were always for the common people, and she urged
      her husband to grant them all their rights and privileges. One of his
      first acts was to abolish the curfew at her request, for she said that
      everybody ought to be permitted to sit up and enjoy an evening chat just
      as long as they pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's Anglo-Saxon subjects soon became so warmly attached to him, that
      they were anxious to show him an allegiance which the stern laws of his
      father, or of the Red King, never could have forced from them. They loved
      the queen also, because they knew that a great deal of their happiness was
      the result of her good influence.

      lived at Westminster, in the palace of Edward the Confessor, and Matilda
      devoted much of her time to the care of the sick and the needy. She was so
      strict concerning her religious duties, that every day in Lent she went to
      Westminster Abbey barefooted and clothed in a garment of haircloth. Then
      she would wash and kiss the feet of the poorest people. One day a courtier
      reproved her for it, but she replied, as the following curious dialogue,
      taken from a rhyming chronicle of the day, will show,&mdash;

      On another occasion, her brother, the King of Scotland, who was on a visit
      to the English court, entered Matilda's apartments, and found her on her
      knees washing the feet of some old beggars. She looked up, and asked him
      if he would not assist her in this work of charity and humiliation, for
      the good of his soul. His majesty smiled and left the room without making
      any reply. Perhaps as he had never had any practice in that sort of labor
      he feared that he might not be able to perform it skilfully, or it may be
      that he did not care to encourage his sister in the humility which she
      seemed inclined to carry to excess. How- <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link063" id="link063">063</a></span>ever, Matilda's good works were
      not all directed in one channel, for she tried to benefit every class of
      her subjects, the rich as well as the poor. Once when she was obliged to
      cross the river Lea on horseback, the tide was so high that she ran great
      danger of being drowned, so she caused a fine arched bridge to be built
      high up the stream. The Saxons called it the Bow Bridge. Then she built
      more of these structures, and to insure their being kept in good repair,
      she presented a mill or dwelling-house to those whom she selected to
      attend to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She planned new roads and repaired old ones, thus facilitating travel
      through the wild, uncultivated parts of the country, so that in time
      merchants could cross the desolate moors with their wares without
      incurring much risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this work was probably done during her husband's absence from home
      when she was regent and could call on the public treasury, for certainly
      her private purse could never have enabled her to undergo such a heavy
      outlay. But that made no difference to her subjects, for they enjoyed the
      benefit of her improvements, and looked upon her as a real benefactress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's wise laws did not give universal satisfaction by any means; for
      the Norman nobles objected to any check being placed on their actions.
      They had been used to doing just exactly as they pleased with only their
      sweet wills to govern them, and now when they found that they could not
      commit crimes and outrages against the lower classes without incurring
      punishment of some sort they made great complaints. They could not
      understand why the laws that protected them and their families should
      apply equally to the common people. Their amusements were restrained, and
      their lawlessness no longer had free play. So they spoke with utter
      contempt of "that Saxon woman," as they called Matilda, and actually went
      so far <span class="pagenum"><a name="link064" id="link064">064</a></span>as
      to apply ridiculous nicknames to the royal couple, before their very
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just two years had passed since their marriage, when Duke Robert returned
      from the Holy Land. He determined at once to invade England. Now, as
      Henry's fleet was manned by Normans, under the influence of Norman chiefs,
      they refused to guard the coasts of England against their duke, but went
      out to meet him, and brought him in triumph to Portsmouth, where he was
      joined by nearly all the Anglo-Norman nobles, as well as a great many of
      the English themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Robert marched straight on to Winchester, but with all his faults,
      he proved himself a true gentleman on this occasion; for when he got there
      he heard that Matilda had a little baby and was ill in bed, so he refused
      to storm the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      This consideration on his part pleased the queen so much, that she used
      her influence to bring about a reconciliation between her husband and his
      brother, and Henry invited Robert to court, where he was feasted and
      entertained in a sumptuous manner. The queen and her brother-in-law had
      one taste in common: they both loved music. It is only a pity that all
      Robert's fancies were not so refined and harmless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poets and minstrels from every part of Europe flocked to Matilda's court
      to recite their verses or sing their songs in her presence, and she took
      great pains to receive them kindly and make them welcome. The only
      objection that could be made to this custom, was that it cost too much
      money, for the queen was exceedingly liberal with her rewards. Robert was
      so well pleased with the treatment he received at his brother's court,
      that he prolonged his stay six months, and he and the queen passed a great
      deal of time in each other's society singing and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link065" id="link065">065</a></span>studying music; and quite a warm
      affection grew up between them.

      <span class="side">A.D. 1104.</span> The following year the Duke of
      Normandy visited England again, probably to demand the payment of his
      pension. As he was accompanied by only twelve gentlemen it could scarcely
      have been his purpose to raise a revolt. Nevertheless, when Henry heard of
      his arrival he said, "By my faith, should he fall into my hands, I will
      keep him so closely imprisoned that he shall never give me any more
      trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of Robert's heard this remark, and hastened to warn him of his
      danger, advising him to seek the queen's protection, which he was very
      glad to do. She spoke kind and comforting words, assuring him that she
      would do all in her power to save him from the anger of the king. But
      Robert was so alarmed that he scarcely listened to what she said. He
      declared himself ready to make almost any sacrifice to insure his personal
      safety, and even offered <span class="pagenum"><a name="link066"
      id="link066">066</a></span>to dispense with the annual sum the king
      regularly allowed him for resigning his claim to the throne.

    </div>
    <p>
      When Henry heard this, he sent for the queen to come to him and bring Duke
      Robert with her. She did so, and the duke thus addressed his brother:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair sire, I am come to show you our of affection, and not to injure
      either you or yours. We are brothers, born of one father and one mother.
      If I am the eldest, you have the honor of the crown, which is a much
      better thing. I love you well, and thus it ought to be. I have given over
      to the queen all you owe me for this kingdom. We will be friends now and
      exchange gifts of jewels, dogs, and birds."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king replied: "We will do as you say, with thanks." Now, one of
      Robert's vices was intemperance, which was so great, that he would often
      be in a state of intoxication for days together. So, not long after his
      friendly speech, when he was under the influence of wine, he accused Henry
      of having cheated him out of his pension, by making Matilda mislead him
      with her fair words. Of course, after that there could be nothing but
      bitter and <span class="pagenum"><a name="link067" id="link067">067</a></span>unkind
      feelings between the royal brothers, and Robert made so many threats, that
      the king embarked for Normandy, determined to make war on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he got there, Anselm, the old archbishop, effected a
      reconciliation. Anselm then returned to England and gave Matilda much
      pain, by putting in force a plan that he had agreed upon with Henry. It
      was to forbid any of the Anglo-Saxon clergy to marry, and to turn those
      out of the church who were already married. Two hundred of these poor
      unfortunates stood barefooted in the streets of London, when Henry
      returned, begging for compassion. He turned aside, and showed plainly that
      they were to look for neither aid nor sympathy from him, while the good
      Matilda wept bitterly, saying that "she dared not interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the royal couple had two children, a boy named William, and a
      little daughter who was placed at Wilton Abbey for care and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Anglo-Normans were so much pleased with the Saxon style of wearing
      their hair, which was in long ringlets flowing to their shoulders, their
      mouths and chins covered with it too, that they soon imitated them. The
      king especially was remarkable for the beauty of his locks, which he
      cherished with care, though the Norman clergy highly disapproved of such
      vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, while Henry was in Normandy, he and his train entered a church,
      where the bishop began to preach about the sinfulness of this new fashion,
      saying, "It was a device of the evil one to bring souls into everlasting
      perdition, the moustached, bearded, and long-haired men resembling filthy
      goats." The discourse was so touching that the King of England and his
      courtiers wept. Then the bishop drew a large pair of scissors from his
      sleeve and proceeded to crop off the curls and beards of his <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link068" id="link068">068</a></span>hearers,
      beginning with Henry, who was anxious to prove the sincerity of his tears.
      Thus for nearly an hour the church resembled a barber-shop, and afterwards
      Henry published an edict forever abolishing such sinful adornments as
      ringlets and beards.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Henry pursued the war in Normandy, completely conquered that
      country, and returned in triumph to England with Edgar Atheling, Robert,
      and four hundred valiant knights as prisoners.
    </p>

    <p>
      He then removed his court to Windsor Castle, which had been completed by
      Matilda during his absence. It now became necessary for Henry to spend
      part of every year in Normandy, as he was ruler of that country as well as
      of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1109 he received an ambassador from the Emperor Henry V., who came to
      make a proposal for the hand of the little Princess Matilda, then only six
      years of age. The offer was accepted, but the child was permitted to
      remain at home until she had reached the mature age of twelve, when she
      was married and crowned in the cathedral of Mentz. The little empress was
      very kindly treated by <span class="pagenum"><a name="link069" id="link069">069</a></span>her
      husband, who was forty years her senior; and she was so amiable and
      pretty, that she won the hearts of the German princes, his sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Prince William was twelve years old, the king took him to Normandy,
      and presented him, with great pomp, as heir to the duchy. The barons and
      freemen swore fealty to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal family passed the following Christmas at the Abbey of St.
      Alban's as guests of the Abbot Richard, who invited them, as well as a
      large company of prelates and nobles, to assist at the consecration of the
      abbey. In a rich illuminated volume, called the Golden Book of St.
      Alban's, (now in the British Museum,) is a likeness of the queen,
      evidently made at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1117, a fresh revolt called Henry to Normandy again, and
      during his absence "the Good Queen," whose health had been failing for
      many months, died. To the last hour of her life she was a beautiful
      example of piety and self-denial, and her virtues had made her so dear to
      her subjects of every class, that she was passionately lamented by them
      all. She was buried at Westminster Abbey near her royal uncle, Edward the
      Confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her death, her three Saxon maids of honor retired to a hermitage
      where there was a holy well, or medicinal spring, and established a
      convent there. They were pious ladies, always ready to bestow alms and
      relieve the sick and suffering, and passed the rest of their lives in
      imitating the charitable, worthy deeds of their royal mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince William never returned to England after the death of his mother,
      but spent much of his time fighting against the King of France, at his
      father's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1119 he married Alice, daughter of the Earl of Anjou. A year later he
      accompanied his father to Harfleur for the purpose of embarking for
      England. The king set <span class="pagenum"><a name="link070" id="link070">070</a></span>sail
      the same night, leaving the prince to follow in the "White Ship" the
      finest vessel in the Norman navy. William went on board with a gay party
      of young friends, and ordered three casks of wine to be given to the
      ship's crew. This was a mistake, for the sailors were, for the most part,
      intoxicated when they sailed. Prince William, desiring to overtake the
      rest of the fleet, ordered his captain to put up all his sails, and the
      "White Ship" went rushing through the water with such dangerous speed,
      that she suddenly struck a rock and began to sink. All was terror and
      confusion. The life-boat was launched, and the young heir of England, with
      several of his companions, got into it, and would probably have been able
      to row back to the Norman shore in safety; but the cries of his
      half-sister calling on him for assistance reached his ear. He commanded
      the boat back, and as soon as it neared the ship, such numbers sprang into
      it that it immediately sank. Out of three hundred persons who embarked on
      the ill-fated vessel only one escaped to tell the sad tale. This was a
      poor butcher, who climbed to the top of the mast, and was rescued next
      morning by some fishermen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the disaster reached England next day, but there was nobody
      bold enough to carry it to the king, so for three days he was left in
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length his private little page was selected to break the news to the
      bereaved father. Entering the room with pattering steps and a sorrowful
      mien, the child knelt down at Henry's feet and told him of the dreadful
      catastrophe. He sank upon the floor in a swoon, from which he did not
      recover for many minutes. In all his life Henry I. was never known to
      smile again.

      <span class="side">A.D. 1120.</span> Three years after the death of Queen

      She occupied the English throne too short a time for us to devote a
      separate chapter to her reign. She was a good, kind stepmother to the
      little Empress Matilda, and took excellent care of her. But she could not
      have been very happy as the wife of Henry I., because his troubles made
      him such a cross, melancholy old man that even his greatest nobles were

      CHAPTER V. MATILDA OF BOULOGNE, QUEEN OF STEPHEN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A.D.1106-1151.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>atilda of Boulogne
      was the last of the Anglo-Norman queens, and the only child of the Count
      and Countess of Boulogne. She was educated at the Convent of Bermondsey,
      which was founded by her mother, but it was never intended that she should
      spend her life there, because, at a very early age, she was married to
      Stephen de Blois, a nephew of Henry I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen was a handsome, bright, intellectual boy when he went to seek his
      fortune at the court of England, and Henry Beauclerc was pleased to have
      an opportunity of showing kindness to the son of his sister Adela,
      Countess of Blois, whom he had always loved very tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he knighted the youth, and bestowed upon him the hand of his queen's
      niece Matilda, the heiress of Boulogne. After the marriage, the king
      presented the young couple with the Tower-Royal, a strongly fortified
      palace, which became their London residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen had embarked on board the ill-fated Blanche Nef, or White Ship,
      with his cousin William, but prudently left just before the vessel sailed,
      saying: "She was too much crowded with foolish, headstrong young people."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of his son William, the king placed his affections on his
      nephew, and always liked his companionship in all his voyages. Stephen was
      a great favorite in <span class="pagenum"><a name="link075" id="link075">075</a></span>England,
      for he was as affable and agreeable to the poorest and humblest people as
      he was to the nobles. His wife, too, was daily winning hearts, and when
      the king's health began to decline, it was fondly hoped that this young
      couple would succeed him instead of his daughter, the Empress Matilda. And
      so they did, for no sooner was King Henry's
    </p>

    <p>
      death announced than Stephen left Normandy, and embarked for Dover,
      leaving the last rites of his deceased uncle to the care of Robert, Earl
      of Gloucester.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastened on to London in the midst of a terrible thunder-storm, and
      convened an assembly of barons, before whom the steward of King Henry's
      household swore that the late sovereign had disinherited the Empress
      Matilda <span class="pagenum"><a name="link076" id="link076">076</a></span>on
      his deathbed, and named Stephen as his heir. Thereupon the Archbishop of
      Canterbury absolved the nobles from the oath of fealty they had twice
      sworn to the daughter of their dead king, and Stephen was crowned without
      opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was easily managed, because the Empress Matilda, being the wife of a
      foreign prince, was residing on the continent, and therefore out of the
      way. Besides, at the time of her father's death, her husband was
      dangerously ill, and she had no thought for anything but the care he
      required. When he recovered she determined to remain quiet for awhile to
      watch the condition of affairs in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1136.</span> Meanwhile Queen Matilda had given
      birth to a son, who was named Eustace, and three months after her husband
      had claimed the crown, her own coronation took place on Easter Sunday,
      1136.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen began his reign by making some wise and popular laws, but he
      permitted his nobles to build or fortify over a thousand castles. This was
      a grave mistake, because the owners of these strongholds could shut
      themselves up in them and defy the crown when they chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sad experience Stephen had in this respect was when the Earl of
      Devonshire refused to obey him, or to acknowledge his right as king.
      Stephen proceeded to chastise him, when the King of Scotland, taking
      advantage of this disturbance, invaded the northern counties under
      pretence of revenging the wrongs of his niece, the Empress Matilda, though
      Queen Matilda stood in the same degree of relationship to him as the
      empress did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen met the King of Scotland with a large army, but Queen Matilda
      interposed between the two sovereigns, and settled all differences without
      any bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1137.</span> This happy termination of the storm
      that had been gathering was celebrated by a series of rejoicings, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link077" id="link077">077</a></span>but in the
      midst of them Stephen was seized with an illness so serious that it
      resulted in a stupor closely resembling death. It was reported in Normandy
      that he really had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the party of the Empress Matilda immediately began to take
      measures to place her on the throne, her husband, the Count of Anjou,
      entering Normandy at the head of an army to assert her right. Then
      Stephen's elder brother, Theobold, put in his claim. Meanwhile Stephen
      recovered, and no sooner did he see the danger that threatened him, than,
      leaving his wife to look out for his interests in England, he hastened
      with his little son to France, and by means of a large bribe induced King
      Louis VII. to acknowledge the child's claim to the earldom of Boulogne,
      which Queen Matilda had bestowed on the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      During King Stephen's absence some enormous fires occurred in different
      parts of England which seemed to be the work of discontented subjects;
      conspiracies were formed in favor of the Empress Matilda, and, what was
      worst of all, the King of Scotland made another invasion into
      Northumberland. But Queen Matilda showed herself a woman of courage and
      determination, for she actually went in person to fight the insurgents,
      and kept them at bay until her husband arrived and drove the Scottish army
      back into their own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party that favored the empress had become so powerful by the autumn of
      1140 that, had she acted promptly, she would certainly have gained the
      prize she sought. But she did not enter England until Stephen had taken
      possession of the castles as well as of the great wealth of three bishops
      who had opposed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, when she took up her abode at Arundel Castle, Stephen might
      perfectly well have made her his <span class="pagenum"><a name="link078"
      id="link078">078</a></span>prisoner; but he remembered what a debt of
      gratitude he owed to her father, and spared her for the sake of his
      benefactor. When she expressed her desire to remove to the Castle of
      Bristol, he was even so gallant as to offer his brother, the Bishop of
      Winchester, as escort, and to pledge his word that she should not be
      molested by the way.

      The Earl of Gloucester was still fighting for his sister's rights when
      Queen Matilda went, with her son Eustace, to France for the purpose of
      strengthening her husband's cause by the aid of her foreign relations.
      While there, a <span class="pagenum"><a name="link079" id="link079">079</a></span>marriage
      was negotiated between Constance, sister of Louis I., and little Eustace,
      who was just four years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matilda was still in France when the battle of Lincoln, so disastrous to
      Stephen's cause, was fought.

    <p>
      It happened that Stephen had shut up a number of the Empress Matilda's
      partisans and their families when he besieged the town of Lincoln; among
      these was the Earl of Gloucester's youngest daughter, who had recently
      married her cousin, the Earl of Chester. So determined were the father and
      husband to liberate her, that, with all their followers, they swam across
      the river Trent, behind which Stephen and his army thought themselves
      safely encamped, and fiercely attacked him in their dripping garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen fought desperately, until he was left almost alone on the field,
      when a stout knight seized him and led him captive before the Empress
      Matilda, who ordered him into close confinement in Bristol Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Empress Matilda made her public entry into the city of
      Winchester, where she was received in state by Stephen's brother, the
      bishop of that place, who excommunicated all those who adhered to the
      imprisoned king, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link080" id="link080">080</a></span>and
      promised absolution to all those who joined the cause of the empress.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this melancholy juncture Queen Matilda returned from France. She at
      once made a personal appeal to the citizens of London, with whom she had
      always been popular, and so readily did they listen to her complaint that
      they demanded the liberation of the king. But her brother-in-law, Henry de
      Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, paid no attention to the demand; he even
      refused to have Queen Matilda's address to the Synod in behalf of her
      husband read aloud, and boldly declared the Empress Matilda sovereign of
      England.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Then Queen Matilda made a pathetic appeal to this haughty, arrogant woman
      in behalf of Stephen, who remained, heavily ironed, in prison. She assured
      the empress that the loss of power was of little moment; all she asked was
      that her husband might be set at liberty. She even proposed that if her
      life were spared, and her son were permitted to enjoy the Earldom of
      Boulogne, she would enter a convent, her husband a monastery, and promised
      that both would forever forego all claim to the crown of England.

      petition, as well as all the others that King Stephen's wife had made to
      the cruel empress, was rejected with contempt. But the devoted wife was
      not to be baffled when working for her husband's life and pardon, so
      taking advantage of a misunderstanding that arose between the Bishop of
      Winchester and the empress, she induced that prelate to absolve all those
      of her husband's party whom he had previously excommunicated, and to aid
      her in the deliverance of his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the name of her son, Prince Eustace, she raised the standard of
      the captive king in Kent and Surrey, and a strong army was soon organized
      in her support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the empress had become exceeding unpopular, and when the
      citizens of London found that she proposed to treat them as a conquered
      nation, which her demand for a subsidy proved, they asked leave to
      deliberate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The empress retired to her palace of Westminster, where she awaited the
      arrival of a deputy with the bags of gold she felt sure they would send.
      Suddenly the bells of London rang out an alarm, and every man in the city
      and its vicinity came out of his house carrying a sword. A formidable army
      soon collected, ready to dispute any unjust demand for subsidies, and
      proceeded to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the empress, with her barons and chevaliers, had made good their
      escape on horseback, and were far on the road to Oxford when the mob broke
      open the doors of the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of Scotland was with his niece, but he was so disgusted with her
      behavior that he made the best of his way to his own borders. By the time
      the empress reached Oxford, all of her train had deserted excepting the
      Duke of Gloucester, with whom she entered the city alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a large army ready to support her, Queen Matilda <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link084" id="link084">084</a></span>now returned to London, where
      she was received by the populace with open arms. Her next step was to go
      with her son to the Bishop of Winchester and entreat him to assist her in
      once more placing her husband on the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promised to do so, and urged the queen to put herself at the head of
      her army and march to Winchester. At her approach, the prelate retired to
      his castle in the suburbs, and a blockade was established that made the
      empress tremble in her palace. No doubt, during the two months of famine
      and warfare that succeeded, she regretted more than once the scorn with
      which she had repulsed her cousin's humble appeal. At last, when at least
      twenty-five churches and monasteries had been destroyed, and the empress
      knew that her position was becoming daily more dangerous, she prevailed on
      her brother, the Duke of Gloucester, to assist her to escape. He and the
      King of Scotland attempted to do so by forcing their way through the
      besiegers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Gloucester fought bravely, but was compelled to surrender at
      last, when he was made captive and conducted before Queen Matilda. The
      King of Scotland escaped with the empress, and got as far as Devizes,
      where the queen's soldiers pursued them so closely that they would
      certainly have been captured but for a stratagem to which the empress was
      compelled to resort for safety. She had herself rolled in a winding-sheet,
      and placed in a coffin, and was in this manner carried on the shoulders of
      some of her faithful partisans to the fortress of Gloucester, which
      belonged to her brother. There she was deposited at last, after many hours
      of travel, worn out with fasting and terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1141.</span> The Duke of Gloucester was so
      necessary to his party, that the empress opened communication with Queen
      Matilda to effect his release. But the only terms

      which the devoted wife would listen, were those that would secure the
      restoration of her husband. Consequently, after many propositions had been
      made on one side and rejected on the other, and after Queen Matilda had
      threatened severe measures against Gloucester, the illustrious prisoners
      were exchanged. This important event took place in November, 1141.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen had another attack of his old malady soon after his release, but
      he recovered with the tender care bestowed upon him by his loving wife,
      and then entered the field again, determined to fight more desperately
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the party of the empress thought they would claim the assistance of
      her husband, the Count of Anjou, for which purpose the Duke of Gloucester
      was despatched to Normandy. Before leaving England, however, he saw his
      sister established at the Castle of Oxford, where he felt perfectly
      certain of her safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Stephen was so bent upon capturing the empress that he laid siege to
      the fortress she occupied and reduced her to such distress for want of
      provisions that she escaped one night with only four attendants. The
      fugitives dressed themselves from head to foot in white, and as the ground
      was all covered with snow, they moved noiselessly and unnoticed along,
      protected by the banks of snow and ice along the Thames, through a
      blinding storm that flew full in their faces. When at a safe distance from
      the castle, they walked faster, over hedges and ditches, until they
      reached a town six miles off, where they obtained horses and rode on to
      Wallingford the same night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the empress met her brother, who had just returned from Normandy.
      The Count of Anjou had not seen fit to comply with the request of his
      wife's party for assistance, but compromised by sending Prince Henry to
      see his mother, keeping their other child, Geoffrey, with <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link088" id="link088">088</a></span>him. He was
      evidently not anxious to see her himself. Three years later the count sent
      a train of Norman nobles to England to reclaim his heir. The Duke of
      Gloucester accompanied his nephew part of the way, and then bade him
      farewell forever; for he died in October, 1147. Deprived of the support of
      this true-hearted brother, the Empress Matilda abandoned hope and left
      England, nearly all of her friends having deserted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen and Matilda were so delighted at the departure of the empress, and
      the establishment of peace, that they celebrated the following Christmas
      with unusual splendor, and prevailed upon some of the barons to swear
      fealty to their son, Eustace, then thirteen years old, and acknowledge him
      as heir-apparent to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1148, Queen Matilda founded and endowed the Church of St. Katherine, by
      the tower; also the Royal Abbey of Feversham in Kent. Then she spent a few
      months quietly at the convent. But her health had begun to decline, and
      she died of a fever on the 3d of May, 1151, at the age of forty-seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was buried at the new abbey of Feversham, and was deeply lamented by
      all who knew her. About three years later Stephen was laid beside his
      beloved queen.

      CHAPTER VI. ELEANORA OF AQUITAINE, QUEEN OF HENRY II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1134-1204.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>leanora was born
      in the beautiful province of Aquitaine, a name that Julius Caesar gave to
      the south of Gaul on account of its numerous rivers and fine ports. The
      people liked the name and adopted it; but it was really the ancient
      kingdom of Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora and her sister Petronilla were daughters of William, Count of
      Poitou, such a good, pious man,'that as he happened to be in the Holy Land
      at the time of his death, he was forever after called St. William.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandfather of these girls was William IX., not a very good man, but a
      learned one, and an excellent poet. The most polished and civilized people
      on the face of the earth in the 12th and 13th centuries were to be found
      in Provence, and their language, which was a mixture of French and
      Italian, was particularly adapted for poetry and music. This is no doubt
      the reason why there were so many minstrels in that country, who wandered
      about from one nobleman's house to another, singing their songs and
      reciting their poems.
    </p>
    <p>
      William IX. was a troubadour, and his compositions were so popular that
      they became models for all the others. He was the most powerful prince in
      all Europe, but as he advanced in years his conscience began to trouble
      him, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="link090" id="link090">090</a></span>he
      thought he must reform before it was too late. So, when Eleanora was about
      fourteen years of age, he ap> pointed her ruler of Aquitaine in his place,
      assembled all the nobles of the land, and made them take an oath of
      allegiance to her, because, as he told them, he wished to occupy himself
      with spiritual matters.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      This done, he planned a marriage between Eleanora and the son of Louis VI.
      of France. The young people had no objections to offer, and they were
      married at Bordeaux without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1137.</span> As soon as they were crowned Duke and
      Duchess of Aquitaine, William IX. laid aside his royal robes forever.
      Attired in a hermit's gown, he started on a pilgrimage to Spain, and
      passed several years in different caves in the gloomy, rocky wilderness,
      where he ended his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Eleanora was a great heiress, because all the rich territory that her
      grandfather had owned passed into her possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, young Louis was crowned Duke of Guienne, when he and his
      youthful bride were summoned to France to attend the death-bed of his
      father, Louis VI., the good king and wise law-maker. His dying words were:
      "Remember, royalty is a public trust, for the exercise of

      rigorous account will be exacted by Him who has the sole disposal of
      crowns and sceptres."
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis was impressed by these words, but they had little weight with the
      thoughtless Eleanora. She was beautiful and accomplished, but seemed to
      think that the chief object in life was enjoyment. She was a fine
      musician, and wrote some beautiful poetry, which she set to music. These
      verses were remembered and sung long after she had ceased to live, which
      proves that they must have had considerable merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora's southern subjects adored her, and were dreadfully grieved
      whenever she had to leave them to return to her court at Paris. She
      preferred to stay among them, too, because, as she had entire control of
      affairs in the south, all was life and fun there, while her husband's
      palace was under such rigid rule that it was almost like a convent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave festivals in Provence, called "Courts of Love," that were very
      popular among her subjects. On such occasions she, with her
      ladies-in-waiting, would receive all the troubadours who chose to come
      with their new poems and songs. The ladies would hear them, and then
      pronounce sentence upon them, and as Eleanora was a very accomplished
      poetess, her judgment was considered of great value.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not induce her husband to take part in these amusements, yet she
      had considerable influence oyer him, which, unfortunately, once led him to
      commit an act of great injustice. It was on account of her sister,
      Petronilla, whose beauty was equal to her own, and whose sense of right
      was sadly wanting. This princess happened to fall in love with a certain
      young count, whose affection she was determined to have, although he was a
      married man. So she and Eleanora put their heads together and planned,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link094" id="link094">094</a></span>until
      they brought about a divorce between the count and his wife for some
      trifling excuse. Then Petronilla married him. But the former wife had a
      brother, the Count of Champagne, who would not stand such treatment
      towards his sister, so he laid the matter before the pope, who commanded
      the divorced count to leave his new wife immediately and take back the
      former one. This so enraged Eleanora that she persuaded her husband to
      punish the Count of Champagne. Louis, who had another cause of offence
      against this man, did not need much urging, and invaded his country at the
      head of a large army. They destroyed right and left until they came to the
      town of Vitry, which they began to storm; thirteen hundred of the
      terrified inhabitants rushed to the cathedral and locked themselves in for
      safety. The building was set on fire by the besiegers, and every soul w'as
      burned to death. About this period the eloquent St. Bernard came to
      Burgundy and preached the crusade. Such crowds of people flocked to hear
      him that they were obliged to meet in the market place, for there was no
      church in the town nearly large enough to contain them. King Louis and
      Queen Eleanora were present also, and the saint spoke so eloquently, and
      in such harsh tones, about the burning of the Vitry cathedral that they
      both felt very repentant. The king resolved to atone for the horrible deed
      by going to the Holy Land to fight for the Christian cause. That was all
      very well, and one can only admire him for such a resolution. But the
      queen vowed that she would accompany her lord, and lead her southern
      forces in person. This was a silly determination for a woman, and the
      excellent Abbot Suger tried to persuade her to give up all idea of such a
      wild expedition, but she had made up her mind to become a female crusader,
      and no argument could change her. Throughout her life, she was weak where
      she ought to have been

      did the same, calling themselves the queen's body-guard. Then they formed
      in parade every day, and practised military exercise in public, making
      themselves as ridiculous as possible. In short, they were a band of
      madwomen, and nobody could control them. When once they had become Amazons
      they abandoned all womanly occupations, consequently had no use for their
      distaffs; these they sent to all the knights and nobles who kept out of
      this insane expedition. Thus, many of them being too weak to stand such a
      taunt, were actually shamed into joining though their good sense opposed
      it.

    <p>
      King Louis managed his difficult enterprise with a good deal of courage
      and prudence, but it would have required a greater general than the world
      has ever known to discipline a regiment of fantastic women. The freaks of
      these female warriors were the cause of all the misfortunes that befell
      the army, for the king, after landing in Thrace, sent them forward with
      his choicest troops, and told them exactly how to choose their camp so
      that they would overlook the valley of Laodicea. He remained about five
      miles behind with the baggage, of which there was a large supply, and had
      to stop frequently to fight the bands of Arabs who attacked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of obeying her husband's directions, Queen Eleanora insisted that
      her part of the army should halt in a lovely valley, full of grass and
      flowers. This inviting spot caught her fancy, and military discipline
      became of secondary importance to her. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link098" id="link098">098</a></span>It was almost night when the
      king approached the valley; he could not distinguish his troops on the
      elevated ground where they ought to have been, and knew not what to make
      of it. The queen was not encamped there, that was certain, so there was
      nothing for him to do but to enter the valley in search of her. Soon after
      he was attacked from the hills by swarms of Arabs, and had to move in and
      out among the rocks to dodge them. At one time he barely escaped with his
      life by climbing a tree, whence he fought desperately. It was daylight
      before he discovered the troops that he had sent in advance. During the
      night seven thousand French soldiers had been killed, the provisions had
      been cut off, the baggage, containing all the fine clothing of the lady
      warriors, had been plundered by the Arabs, and the whole army was in great
      distress. Fortunately, Eleanora had an uncle living near by; his name was
      Prince Raymond, and he was the handsomest man of his time. He threw open
      his friendly gates to the defeated French army, and they were glad to rest
      and refresh themselves after all the hardships they had endured. The uncle
      and niece met for the first time, and were so charmed with each other that
      Louis soon became jealous; so one night he hurried his wife off without
      taking leave of his polite host. This made Eleanora so angry that when
      they arrived at Jerusalem she did nothing but grumble and complain. Most
      pilgrims had their piety aroused on this holy ground, but it was not so
      with Eleanora; she wanted to get home, and quarrelled with her husband for
      keeping her there. In fact, she never forgave him for forcing her away
      from her uncle's agreeable company, and from that time all affection w'as
      at an end between this royal couple Eleanora was not willing to submit to
      restraint of any sort, and her husband's temper was so tried that he
      resolved to have a divorce. So, on his return to Paris, he consulted <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link099" id="link099">099</a></span>his
      confidant, the Abbot Suger, about this matter. That worthy man advised him
      to wait; because, he argued, that it would be troublesome for France to
      have to give up the money Eleanora's provinces in the south yielded;
      besides Louis' daughter, the Princess Marie, would probably be deprived of
      her inheritance if her mother should take it into her head to marry again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis accepted this advice, but he had his wife closely watched, and would
      not allow her to go to Provence at all. She complained of the stupid life
      she led in Paris, and made great fun of her husband for wearing plain
      clothing and keeping his head and beard closely cropped, which she
      declared made him look more like a priest than a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in time another princess was born, and named Alice. Soon after this
      event Henry Plantagenet visited Paris. He was a noble-looking young
      prince, full of energy and very intellectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1151.</span> Eleanora fell so desperately in love
      with him that without hesitation or advice she applied for a divorce from
      Louis, and got it. No doubt the king was glad to be rid of such an
      undutiful, unwomanly wife, though he did have to give up all control over
      his southern provinces, even Guienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora went straight to her favorite home, where Henry Plantagenet
      followed her. He was probably not so very much in love with her, for she
      was twelve years his senior, but he needed her money and her ships to
      fight King Stephen, and lay claim to the throne of England, which he did
      during the first year of their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned in triumph, and was besieging the castle of a rebel duke in
      Normandy when the news of Stephen's death reached him. For six weeks
      England was without a king, until Eleanora and Henry arrived with their
      young son. They were crowned at Westminster Abbey in 1154, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link100" id="link100">100</a></span>and such a
      magnificent coronation had never been seen. The costumes of costly silk
      and brocade worn on that occasion had been brought by Eleanora from
      Constantinople. In one of her portraits she wears a close coif, or hood,
      over which is a band of precious stones; a rich brocade gown is fastened
      with full gathers just below the throat, and confined there with a costly
      collar of exquisite gems. Over this is an outer robe, or pelisse, bordered
      with fur, the large sleeves of which fall open from the shoulder,
      displaying the tight ones of the gown beneath. In some portraits her hair
      is braided and wound closely around her head with jewelled bands, and over
      this is a piece of fine gauze, which could be so arranged as to serve the
      double purpose of veil or bonnet, just as the wearer chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before marriage, the girls of that time wore their hair in long ringlets,
      but the church required married ladies to conceal their locks. After Henry
      I. cut off his curls, and forbade his courtiers to wear their hair long,
      they adopted wigs, but Henry II. abolished them, and appeared at his
      coronation with short hair and shaven chin. His dalmatica, or long gown,
      was of the richest brocade with elaborate gold embroidery; over this he
      wore the short cloak afterwards called the court-mantle. This coronation
      introduced into England the sumptuous robes of silk and velvet worn by the
      ecclesiastics there on that occasion. The queen's first residence in
      England was at a little village nearly opposite to London, and she must
      have been struck with the grandeur of that remarkable city, with its
      tower, its tall spires, and the river Thames running through it, so
      different from anything she had ever seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although she did not please her new subjects, who were acquainted, of
      course, with her former behavior, they felt the advantage of being
      connected with her Aquitainian dominion, and in a few months large
      fortunes were <span class="pagenum"><a name="link101" id="link101">101</a></span>made
      by the London traders in the wines imported from the port of Bordeaux.

      One of the queen's country residences was at Woodstock, where rather a
      peculiar incident occurred. She was resting in the park, concealed by the
      shrubbery, one day when the king passed so close to her that she observed
      a thread of silk tightly twisted into his spur. She wondered where he
      could have been to have picked up such a thing, so, as he moved off, she
      cut it, and resolved to ferret out the mystery. Next day he left Woodstock
      for a long journey, and the queen immediately thought that now was her
      time to gratify her curiosity. So she sought the piece of silk, which
      proved to be the end of a ball, and followed its windings among the roads
      and thickets until she came to a door cunningly concealed by a luxuriant
      vine. This she opened, and found it to be the entrance to a winding path
      under ground. A few minutes' walk brought her to a bower at the further
      end of the forest, in which sat an exceedingly pretty young girl
      embroidering. "Aha!" thought the lady, "now we know where Henry gets his
      spurs caught in balls of silk."
    </p>
    <p>
      This girl was Rosamond Clifford, who was said to have been a playmate of
      Henry's in his youth, and as she was kept a prisoner, it is probable that
      she did not know of his marriage until his wife informed her of it. At all
      events, nobody ever heard what took place at this interview, but it is
      certain that, in obedience to the queen's commands, Rosamond entered the
      convent of Godstowe, where she passed the remaining twenty years of her
      life.

      II. fancied himself about to die, he left dominions to all his sons

      Little Matilda was three years old when she was married to Henry the Lion,
      Duke of Saxony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A revolt in the south of France caused Eleanora's return, because her
      subjects there insisted on having her to rule them. King Henry escorted
      her to Bordeaux, where she stayed with her son Richard.

      name="link102" id="link102">102</a></span> Shortly after this adventure,
      the Princess Matilda was born, and a year later the celebrated Richard
      Cour de Lion came into the world. In course of time, Queen Eleanora had
      several other children, among whom was John, surnamed Lackland, because
      once, when Henry <span class="pagenum"><a name="link105" id="link105">105</a></span>Great
      disputes had been going on in England for a long time between the church
      and state, headed by Thomas à Becket, the celebrated Archbishop of
      Canterbury. Prince Henry was so devoted to this priest, who had been his
      tutor, that the king became jealous of the influence exerted by Becket
      over the mind of his son. In order to change the current of the prince's
      thoughts, the father offered him a share in the government of his kingdom.
      This was gladly accepted, and young Henry was crowned. But he had a
      perverse little wife, Marguerite, daughter of Louis VII., who was fond of
      Becket, too, and she vowed that she would wear no crown that had not been
      placed on her head by that fascinating prelate; so she remained with her
      mother-in-law at Aquitaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Henry met with so much opposition at the hands of Becket that he
      became enraged at the very sight of that priest. Once, when he was the
      subject of conversation among his knights, Henry asked, angrily, "whether
      no man loved him enough to revenge the affronts he perpetually received
      from an insolent priest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1171.</span> Four armed men instantly proceeded to
      the cathedral, and slaughtered the archbishop while he was kneeling before
      the altar in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this happened Eleanora was still in the south with her son Richard,
      who had been crowned Count of Poitou. Suddenly she chanced to hear that
      Henry was thinking about getting a divorce from her, so she resolved to
      seek the protection of her former husband, the King of France. Disguised
      in male attire, she stole out of the palace at night, and started on her
      journey. But Henry had his Norman agents on the spot, and they watched her
      so closely that her absence was discovered in time for them to overtake
      her. They captured her very roughly, and brought her back to Bordeaux,
      where she was kept in close <span class="pagenum"><a name="link106"
      id="link106">106</a></span>imprisonment until her lord was summoned. He
      remained only a few days in the south, then went back to England with two
      royal captives, his wife and the young Princess Marguerite, whom he had
      not forgiven for scorning the crown he offered unless it could be
      consecrated by his enemy, Becket. Now, that he had her in his power, he
      resolved to punish her. But after a few months' confinement she was
      restored to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora was not so fortunate, for she was kept a prisoner at the royal
      palace of Winchester for nearly sixteen years. During that time there was
      no end of strife among her sons. The real mischief-makers were the
      troubadours, of whom we have spoken, for with their inspiring war songs
      they were constantly urging the princes to battle for one trivial reason
      or another, even when they would gladly have been at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that the queen was unkindly treated at Winchester,
      for, on the contrary, she received the attention and respect due to her
      station. While she was there Louis VII., her divorced husband, died; and
      shortly after, the death of her eldest son, Henry Plantagenet, followed.
      This was a great sorrow to the royal couple, and Henry mourned with the
      deep grief of David over Absalom. Still later, their son Geoffrey was
      killed in a grand tournament in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of her letters to the pope, the queen thus writes about these
      bereavements: "The younger king and Geoffrey, Count of Bretagne, both
      sleep in the dust, while their most wretched mother is compelled to live
      on, though tortured by recollections of the dead.".
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1189, Henry II. died, and was succeeded by his son Richard I., Cour de
      Lion. About the first act of the new king was to order his mother's
      release, and from a captive Queen Eleanora at once became a sovereign, for
      the reins

      government were placed in her hands as regent. Her long confinement must
      have had a good effect on her, for she went about, from city to city,
      releasing all the poor people that her husband had cruelly locked up for
      violating the Norman game laws, and spent her whole time in acts of mercy
      and charity. Richard was crowned in 1189, but, as his mother's mourning
      prevented her being present on that occasion, no women were admitted at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king then settled a most liberal revenue on his mother, and she went
      to Aquitaine, the government of which was also restored to her. But she
      did not stay there; her old age was passed in England, where she assisted
      her son in governing, and made him, as well as herself, exceedingly
      popular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora of Aquitaine is among the very few women who, after an ill-spent
      youth, have become wise and benevolent in old age. But she had a great
      deal more trouble to bear before her death. Her life exhibits many traces
      of a great ruler. If she had only been blessed in her early days with a
      good, moral education, she would have been one of the greatest women of
      her time. Slowly and surely she learned the stern lesson of life, which
      teaches that without virtue, power, beauty and royalty are of slight
      avail.

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1204.</span> She was a very old woman when she
      retired to a convent, where she spent many months previous to her death,
      which occurred in 1204. She was buried by the side of Henry II., and on
      her tomb is a reclining statue said to be a good portrait of herself. The
      features are noble and intellectual. On the head is a hood, above which is
      a regal diadem; and a blue mantle, figured with silver crescents, is
      folded gracefully about her form. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link110"

      CHAPTER VII. BERENGARIA OF NAVARRE, QUEEN OF RICHARD I.

      Lion first met the beautiful, accomplished Berengaria at a tournament, and
      fell desperately in love with her; but, unfortunately, he was at that time
      engaged to Alice of France, so could not offer his hand to the Provençal
      princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Sancho the Wise, King of Navarre, Berengaria's father, and Sancho the
      Strong, her brother, were poets of considerable merit, and early came
      under the notice of Richard, who was not only a troubadour poet, but as
      sovereign of Aquitaine, he was, besides, the prince and judge of all the
      troubadours. Between him and Berengaria's brother a warm friendship was
      formed in early youth, strengthened by their similarity of tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until after his father's death that Richard was at liberty to
      marry the Princess Berengaria, to whom he had been secretly engaged for
      several years. So she was about twenty-six years old when Richard ascended
      the throne of England. He at once sent his mother, Queen Eleanora, to the
      court of Sancho the Wise to demand the princess in marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal father was much pleased, and placed his daughter in charge of
      the queen without hesitation. The two ladies set out together and
      travelled as far as Naples, where ships awaited them in the bay. But the

      not join her lover until he had broken off his engagement with Alice; so
      she spent the spring of 1191 at Brindisi with his mother. At last a
      message came from Richard announcing that he was free to marry, then his
      lady-love returned to France with his sister, Queen Joanna, in whose
      charge she had been placed by the queen mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Richard was waiting the arrival of Berengaria, he instituted the
      order of Knights of the Blue Thong, to scale the walls of Acre. They were
      twenty-four in number, and were distinguished by a band of blue leather
      which each wore on his left leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1192.</span> It was Lent when Berengaria met her
      royal lover, therefore their marriage had to be postponed; but so anxious
      was Richard to begin his crusade, that he set out at once with his knights
      in his favorite ship, which he had named "<i>Trenc-the-mere</i>," meaning
      cut the sea. His fleet consisted of one hundred and fifty ships and fifty
      galleys. Among the latter was one in which Berengaria and Queen Joanna,
      guarded by a brave knight; accompanied the crusaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dreadful storm drove the galley which contained the queen and princess
      into the harbor of Limoussa, the capital of Cyprus, but when Isaac
      Comnenus, the lord of the isle, found out who they were, he brutally
      refused them shelter, and they were obliged to row out of the harbor. As
      soon as the gale abated, Richard Cour de Lion, who had found shelter in a
      harbor of Crete, started in search of his bride. When he beheld her ship
      pitching and tossing in the Bay of Famaguta, he suspected that something
      had prevented the knight in charge from seeking the protection so near at
      hand. Armed, as he was, he jumped into the first boat that could be got
      ready, and when, on reaching the queen's galley, he heard how the Lord of
      Cyprus had behaved, his fury knew no bounds.

      The Queens of England. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link114" id="link114">114</a></span>Determined
      to punish the offender at once, Richard led his crusaders straight to
      Limoussa, and made such a sudden and desperate attack that in a few hours
      he had captured the town, and all the inhabitants had scampered to the
      neighboring mountains for shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in response to King Richard's signals, the queen's vessel entered
      the harbor and landed at Limoussa, where grand preparations were soon
      under way for the marriage and coronation of the royal pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding ceremony was performed in the month of May, 1191, and King
      Richard gave a grand feast, to which he invited the people of Cyprus.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that occasion Berengaria wore a richly-embroidered robe of velvet and
      satin. Her dark hair fell in curls, over which hung a full long lace veil,
      fastened to a crown studded with rich jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard wore a short rose-colored satin skirt, with a brocaded mantle
      embroidered in silver. A richly jewelled Damascus sword hung at his side,
      and on his head he wore a scarlet hood, brocaded in gold with figures of
      animals. He had a bright complexion, and curly, yellow hair, and' his
      figure was a perfect model of manly grace and strength.

      The people of Cyprus had been so tyrannized over by Isaac Comnenus that
      they gladly consented to receive Richard for their king; therefore, by the
      advice of all the crusaders who had witnessed his marriage, he was crowned
      King of Cyprus, and his bride Queen of England and Cyprus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the daughter of the despot, Isaac, threw herself at King Richard's
      feet and asked for mercy. He kindly raised her from the ground and sent
      her to his wife and sister, with whom she remained until the end of the
      crusade. Her father was bound in silver chains and presented to Queen
      Berengaria as her captive.

      more the fleet set sail for Palestine, and when Richard appeared' before
      Acre, the whole army of Christians, already assembled there, marched to
      the beach to welcome him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town was soon taken, and before proceeding further, Richard
      established his wife and sister in safe quarters there, under the
      protection of a couple of brave knights, to await his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard distinguished himself by many brave deeds during his Syrian
      campaign, and captured several important towns, but Jerusalem did not fall
      into his hands. Once he was in sight of that coveted city, when the Duke
      of Burgundy, who commanded the French forces, suddenly drew back with his
      whole division when victory seemed certain, because he would not have it
      said that the King of England had taken Jerusalem. This act, which was
      prompted by envy, was a serious blow to Richard, who, throwing down his
      weapon, said, with tears in his eyes and his hands raised to heaven:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Lord God, I pray thee that I may never see thy holy city, Jerusalem,
      since I have failed to deliver it from the hands of thine enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to Acre in 1192, and, after spending a few days with his wife
      and sister, saw them embark for home on the very day he himself set out in
      the disguise of a Templar to return across Europe by a different route.
    </p>
    <p>
      His vessel was wrecked off the coast of Istria, and his ignorance of
      geography led him to the neighborhood of Vienna, the capital of his enemy,
      Leopold of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after several narrow escapes, he sent a page to make some
      purchases at a village near Vienna. The boy was recognized by an officer
      who had been in the late crusade with Leopold's troops. He was seized, and
      after suffering much cruelty, confessed where he had left his <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link118" id="link118">118</a></span>master. A
      party of soldiers set out for the inn designated, but could not find King
      Richard. The landlord said, on being questioned: "No, there is no stranger
      here, unless it be the Templar in the kitchen, who is turning the fowls
      which are roasting for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Austrian officer, accompanied by his soldiers, proceeded at once to
      the kitchen, recognized the king, who sure enough was busily turning the
      spit, and cried: "There he is. Seize him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cour de Lion started up and fought desperately for liberty, but he was
      only one man against a dozen, who captured him and carried him in chains
      before Leopold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was forthwith locked up in a gloomy prison, where he remained for many
      months, no one knowing whether he was alive or dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Berengaria and Joanna had landed at Naples and proceeded to
      Rome, where they remained six months. While there, Berengaria saw a belt
      of jewels offered for sale that she knew Richard had worn when he parted
      from her. This convinced her that something dreadful had happened to him,
      but she had no means of finding out the truth, and as soon as she could
      get a safe escort she journeyed on until she arrived at Poitou.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, poor Richard fancied himself forgotten, and bitterly
      lamented because he had no friend nor relation who loved him enough to
      rescue him. But he was wrong, for as soon as his mother heard of his
      captivity she spared no pains nor money to obtain his release. It was a
      long time, though, before the exact spot of his imprisonment could be
      ascertained, and this is how it happened, after many months: A certain
      troubadour knight who had been with Richard when he was shipwrecked at
      Istria, having heard of his captivity, wandered around through the
      southern cities of Germany in search of him. One day he

      beneath the tower that formed Richard's prison, and sang a song that he
      and the king had composed together. When he finished the first stanza, the
      prisoner replied with the second; then the troubadour hastened with all
      speed to Queen Eleanora with the discovery he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took immediate measures for her son's release, and with the assistance
      of the pope, to whom she made a most pathetic appeal, a large ransom was
      collected, with which the devoted mother set out for Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1195.</span> After an absence of more than four
      years, Richard arrived in England in company with Queen Eleanora.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his imprisonment, John, his younger brother, had tried to possess
      himself of the crown of England. It was the mother who prevented anything
      so disgraceful, and who kept all Richard's dominions intact, and it was
      she who proudly sat beside her brave son at his second coronation, which
      took place in his own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berengaria remained in France, and Richard was not at all anxious to join
      her there, or to have her with him. The reason for this remarkable conduct
      on the part of a husband is that on his return to England Richard had been
      met by his former bachelor friends, into whose way of living he fell, much
      to the disgust of the more sober of his subjects. He drank with them to
      excess, and led such a gay, bad life, that Berengaria could not join him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he became alarmingly ill, and began to repent of his neglect of
      his wife; but he knew that she was justly displeased with him, and did not
      dare to approach her. So he assembled at his bedside all the monks within
      ten miles and publicly confessed his sins, vowing that if Queen Berengaria
      would forgive him he would never forsake her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later he went to France and became <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link122" id="link122">122</a></span>reconciled to his wife. It was a
      year of famine and of suffering among the poor, and the queen used her
      newly-restored influence over the heart of Richard to persuade him to many
      acts of charity that preserved the lives of a number of families. The
      Christmas of the year 1196, which occurred shortly after the king's
      arrival in France, was celebrated in grand style.
    </p>
    <p>
      Berengaria accompanied her husband in all his campaigns after that, and
      never left him during the remaining three years of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when Richard was storming the Castle of Chaluz, in April, 1199,
      that an arrow pierced his breast and caused his death. He was buried at
      the Abbey of Fontevraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Berengaria went to live at Mans, where she founded the Abbey of
      L'Espan, and devoted her life to deeds of charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lived to an advanced age, and was buried at the abbey she had founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deserves to be remembered as a Queen of England who was never in that
      country, and as a woman possessed of many noble virtues.

      CHAPTER VIII. ISABELLA OF ANGOULEME, QUEEN OF KING JOHN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1185-1246.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ohn ascended the
      throne of England on the death of his brother, Richard Cour de Lion, and
      it was at a festival given to him at Angouleme that he first made the
      acquaintance of Isabella, who afterwards became queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1200.</span> She was just fifteen years old and so
      beautiful that King John fell madly in love with her. She was engaged to
      Hugh de Lusignan at the time, but her parents were so ambitious for her to
      be raised to the lofty position of Queen of England, that they kept her
      with them after the festival instead of allowing her to return to the
      Castle of Valence, the possession of her betrothed, where she had been
      living under the protection of the Count of Eu, his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella really loved Hugh de Lusignan, but she was dazzled by the
      splendor of the triple crown of England, Normandy and Aquitaine, and, as
      her lover was absent, she denied that she had ever consented to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the feudal laws of the thirteenth century, King John, as
      ruler of Aquitaine, had the power to prevent any marriage that the
      Provençale princess might contract, if he chose, and to deprive her of her
      inheritance besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, when King John and Isabella were married, in the month of August,
      1200, Count Hugh dared not interfere to prevent it. But he challenged the
      king to mortal combat. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link124" id="link124">124</a></span>The
      reply he got was that if he wished to fight a champion should be appointed
      for that purpose, but he was indignant at such a proposition and
      determined to await an opportunity for revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella sailed with her husband for England, where she was duly crowned
      by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Six months of feasting and enjoyment
      succeeded, which were only terminated at last by rumors of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, King John retired with his wife to Rouen, where he led such a
      life of indolent ease as to excite the displeasure of all who surrounded
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother, the aged Eleanora, was then residing at the Castle of Mirabel
      in Poitou, and was the ruler of Aquitaine. Quite suddenly and unexpectedly
      her residence was besieged by Hugh de Lusignan, whose plan was to capture
      the old lady and exchange her only for his lost love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eleanora held out heroically until the arrival of her son John, whom
      she had summoned at the first signal of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      King John's enemies had reckoned on his character as a sluggard, but they
      found their mistake, for when he heard of the attack on his mother he
      hastened to Mirabel with lightning speed, hemmed in Count Hugh and Duke
      Arthur of Bretagne, who had joined him, and took both prisoners. The one
      was his rival in love, the other in empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Hugh was subjected to the most insulting treatment at the hands of
      the king, who had him and the other insurgent barons of Poitou chained
      hand and foot to carts drawn by oxen. In this manner they were forced to
      follow him wherever he went, until he made them embark with him for
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      King John was not so cruel to his nephew, Arthur, whom he merely had
      locked up in the citadel of Falaise,

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1204.</span> In 1204 Queen Eleanora died, and from
      that moment her son John seemed lost to all sense of decency or fear, and
      became more corrupt and wicked than the most brutal of his subjects. Queen
      Isabella's influence was no check on his notorious conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1206 he entered into a treaty with his prisoner, Hugh de Lusignan, with
      whose aid he conquered the southern part of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to England he made some most unreasonable demands of his
      barons, one of them being the surrender of their children as hostages.
      Those young nobles who fell into his hands were required to attend the
      queen, serve her at meals and follow her at cavalcades and processions.
      The Lord of Bramber resisted the King's demand, whereupon he, with his
      wife and five children, were all shut up in a room at the old Castle of
      Windsor and deliberately starved to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1211.</span> Queen Isabella had given birth to
      several children, but that did not prevent her brutal husband from
      treating her with extreme harshness. Once, when he fancied that she had a
      fancy for a certain knight, he had the man assassinated, and his dead body
      suspended over her bed. Then he shut her up in Gloucester Abbey, where she
      remained until 1213, when it suited his majesty to take her with him to
      Angoulême.
    </p>
    <p>
      King John found himself again in need of Hugh de Lusignan's assistance
      when Philip Augustus of France seized the northern provinces. But that
      brave count refused his aid unless the king would give him his eldest
      daughter, Joanna, for a wife. This was a singular request, considering
      that he had once been engaged to the mother, but he was gratified, and the
      infant princess was <span class="pagenum"><a name="link128" id="link128">128</a></span>forthwith
      handed over to him to be brought up in one of his castles as her mother
      had been before her. Count Hugh soon cleared the northern provinces of
      France of the invaders, and then John returned to England to perpetrate
      new acts of tyranny.

      Charta, which granted certain privileges to all his subjects, King John
      behaved like a madman, giving way to outbursts of fury, cursing the hour
      of his birth, and biting and gnawing sticks and clubs until he reduced
      them to small bits. The result of several sleepless nights at the fortress
      of Windsor, the scene of many secret murders, was an expedition to the
      Isle of Wight, where, after idly sauntering on the beach for days at a
      time and conversing with the fishermen, he joined a band of pirates with
      whom he made attacks on his own subjects. He was gone so long that

      he would never return, but, like a bad penny, he turned up at the end of a
      few weeks, when he was joined by troops from Brabant and Guienne, whom he
      had summoned to aid him in revenging himself on the rebellious barons.
      This he did by travelling around among them, obliging them to entertain
      him, and then turning upon them and doing some damage to their lives or
      property. It was not uncommon for him to set fire to a house in which he
      had been sheltered over night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this diabolical career, Queen Isabella met her husband at
      Marlborough, and after spending a few weeks with him, retired to
      Gloucester with her children.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was there, Prince Louis of France made an invasion into England,
      prompted to the act by the barons, who were so incensed against their
      sovereign that they offered him the crown if he would come to their aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the tormentor tried to escape towards the north, but when he thought
      to cross the Wash to Lincolnshire, part of his army, his baggage, and his
      splendid regalia were lost, and he barely escaped with his life. He
      arrived at Swinshead Abbey ill and in a horrible temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his usual brutality, he gave vent to his spleen by saying, while
      eating in the abbot's refectory, "that he hoped to make the half-penny
      loaf cost a shilling before the year was over."
    </p>
    <p>
      This malicious speech was heard by several monks, who, thinking that
      John's outrages had extended far enough, treated him to a dose of poison
      served in a dish of stewed pears. Ill as he was from the effect of the
      poison, the king insisted on proceeding on his journey, and was therefore
      carried on a litter to Newark, where he summoned several monks for the
      purpose of confession. It was no trifling matter for this sinful man to
      recount all the wrongs of which he had been guilty, but having
      accomplished it, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link132" id="link132">132</a></span>he
      forgave his enemies and made all the officers about him swear fealty to

      In the year 1220 he returned, and frequently met the mother of his little
      promised bride. The consequence was, that his early love was renewed, and
      as Isabella was still a very handsome woman, only a few years younger than
      himself, she was a much more appropriate mate for him than Joanna could
      have been.

      So they were married without asking the advice or consent of any one in

      offer the king the hand of the little Princess Joanna in marriage, so when
      Henry wrote his mother a congratulatory letter on her nuptials, he
      demanded, at the same time, the restoration of his sister. Isabella
      refused to give up the princess, because she was highly displeased at
      being deprived of her jointure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the young king applied to the pope, who took great pains to
      inquire into the merits of the case. A voluminous correspondence was
      carried on between the contending parties. The King of Scots insisted upon
      his marriage with Joanna before he would come to terms; the result was the
      payment of all the money due to Queen Isabella in exchange for her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of France was the liege-lord of the Count de <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link136" id="link136">136</a></span>Lusignan, and it was so hurtful
      to the pride of Isabella to see her husband kneel at the feet of any man,
      that she gave him no rest until he joined her son, Henry III., whom she
      had instigated to undertake the conquest of Poitou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several years of warfare ensued, and at last the King of England fled to
      Bordeaux. De Lusignan's possessions were overrun by the enemy, and Queen
      Isabella was forced, after much suffering, to throw herself on the mercy
      of the King of France, Louis IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to his camp with her husband and children, and, falling at his
      feet, begged for mercy. He received them kindly, and granted forgiveness
      on easy conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, so ungrateful did Isabella show herself, that when an
      attempt was made on the life of good King Louis, in 1244, it was proved
      that she had bribed people to poison him. She flew to the Abbey of
      Fontevraud for protection, and there hid herself from the French, who held
      her responsible for so much sorrow and bloodshed that they gave her the
      name of Jezebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She died in 1246, and was buried in the common cemetery of Fontevraud.
      Some years later her son, Henry III., raised a stately monument over her
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Lusignan joined a crusade after the death of his wife, and was killed
      at one of the battles in 1249. His eldest son was known as Hugh XI., Count
      de la Marche and Angoulême. His other children were liberally provided for
      by Henry III., much to the indignation of his English subjects.

      CHAPTER IX. ELEANOR OF PROVENCE, QUEEN OF HENRY III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1222 - 1291.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>leanor of Provence
      was married when she was only fourteen years old, and became the most
      unpopular queen that ever reigned over the English court. She was so
      beautiful as to be called <i>La Belle</i>, but her judgment was too
      immature tor her to stand all the adulation she received without being
      spoiled by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she entered her teens, Eleanor had written a poem in the Provençal
      dialect, which is remembered in her native country to this day. Born in
      that land of poetry and song, of parents who were both popular poets among
      the troubadors, young Eleanor's talent was fostered and encouraged by the
      very air she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this talent that was the means of placing her on the throne, for
      she wrote a romance in verse, selecting Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was
      then preparing a crusade, for her hero. Romeo, her tutor, and one of the
      greatest Italian poets of his day, was so proud of his pupil, that he
      carried the composition to Richard, who was immensely flattered by it. But
      he could not, in return for the compliment, offer his hand and heart to <i>La
      Belle</i> Eleanor because he was already provided with one wife; therefore
      he did the next best thing&mdash;recommended her to his brother, Henry
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      So delighted was this king with the accounts he received of the beauty and
      genius of the maid of Provence, that <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link138" id="link138">138</a></span>he put 'a stop to the treaty
      under way for the hand of Joanna, daughter of the Earl of Pembroke, and
      forthwith despatched ambassadors to the court of Count Berenger to demand
      his daughter Eleanor in marriage. With the covetousness for which he was
      noted, he added a dower of twenty thousand marks to his demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court objected to so large a sum. Henry lowered it, but even then the
      father would not agree, and so much bargaining was the result that the
      high-spirited court was on the point of putting an end to the affair
      altogether, when a peremptory order came from the king to conclude the
      marriage at once, with or without money. Then the contract was signed and
      the maiden was delivered with due solemnity to the ambassadors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she commenced her journey to England, the royal bride was attended by
      a train of knights, ladies and minstrels who accompanied her to the French
      frontier. There she was met by her eldest sister, the wife of King Louis,
      and after receiving the congratulations of her relatives, she embarked for
      Dover and landed there January 4, 1236.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1236.</span> She was married at Canterbury, where
      King Henry had received her with a splendid train of followers, and after
      the ceremony the royal couple proceeded to London, where preparations on a
      very grand scale had been made for the reception and coronation of the new
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her apartments at Westminster Palace had been newly decorated and
      furnished by order of the king, and all the streets of London had been
      thoroughly cleansed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 20th of January was appointed for the coronation, and on the previous
      Saturday, Henry laid the first stone of the Lady Chapel in Westminster
      Abbey.
    </p>

      with flags, banners and garlands of flowers, and the houses were gaily
      decorated. Three hundred and sixty equestrians, preceded by the king's
      trumpeters, who sounded as they moved along, accompanied the royal pair
      from the tower. These were loyal citizens, who, mounted on richly
      caparisoned horses and clad in bright, embroidered satin and velvet
      garments, each carried in his hand a gold or silver cup to be used at the
      banquet. They were called cellarers, and it was their duty to hand wine to
      the royal butler, who passed it to the sovereigns. After the banquet, the
      butler always claimed the cup out of which the king had drank, the curtain
      that hung behind the royal table became the property of the doorkeepers,
      other perquisites being divided among the cooks and scullions. King Henry
      was very charitable and did not forget the poor, among whom a liberal
      supply of money was distributed by his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this coronation were worn the most splendid garments ever seen in
      England. They were made of the costliest satin and velvet, richly,
      embroidered in gold and silver, and the ladies wore head-dresses composed
      of rare and precious gems. The queen's crown was worth £1500, and her
      girdle was studded with jewels of great value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who had a taste for finery not often seen in men, wore a garment
      of gold tissue that glittered with every motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expenses of Eleanor's coronation were so enormous that the king had to
      petition the Lords for money. They refused, saying, "that they had amply
      supplied funds both for his marriage and that of his sister Isabella, who
      had just been united to the Emperor of Germany; and as he had wasted the
      money he might defray the expenses of his wedding as best he could."
    </p>
    <p>
      Great dissatisfaction was felt in England on account of <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link142" id="link142">142</a></span>the number of
      foreigners who had accompanied Queen Eleanor. Among these was her uncle,
      Peter of Savoy, who by the end of a year had gained such complete control
      over Henry that all the affairs of the kingdom were submitted to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout his reign, Henry III. too frequently made demands on the purses
      of his subjects, to supply his unbounded extravagance, and Queen Eleanor
      was no check to him in this respect. Their tastes were similar, and Henry
      had in his wife a congenial companion, interested, as he was, in
      literature and art. Her influence over him was unbounded, and he was never
      known to refuse any demand she made, no matter how unreasonable it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first child was born at Westminster in 1239, and received the name
      of Edward, in honor of Edward the Confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      An attempt was made on the king's life one night by a crazy man named
      Ribald, who concealed himself in the palace during the day and stole into
      the king's bed-chamber at midnight. Fortunately Henry spent the night in
      another apartment, otherwise the score of stabs that the madman inflicted
      on the bolster would certainly have put an end to his majesty. The shrieks
      of one of the queen's maids of honor, who heard the would-be murderer
      shouting horrible threats with each thrust of his dagger, aroused the
      household, and the wretch was taken into custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1241.</span> In 1241, a year after the birth of
      her daughter Margaret, Queen Eleanor accompanied her husband to France, on
      an expedition against their brother-in-law, King Louis. After a series of
      defeats, they took refuge in Bordeaux, where many of Henry's knights and
      nobles forsook him and returned to England. He revenged himself by
      imposing upon them heavy fines,&mdash;his favorite mode of punishment

      and Eleanor spent a merry winter at Bordeaux, amusing themselves with
      feasts and pageants that they could ill afford, and on their return to
      England, in 1243, Henry issued an order compelling the principal
      inhabitants of every town on the route to appear on horseback to give them
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1243.</span> The marriage of the queen's youngest
      sister, to the king's brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who had become a
      widower, was solemnized in England the following autumn. On that occasion
      Henry called upon his Jewish subjects to furnish funds for the sumptuous
      festivities that he saw fit to give, and he spared no expense, for the
      wedding-dinner alone consisted of thirty thousand dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remembered the poor as usual, and ordered all the children from the
      streets and highways of Windsor and its neighborhood to be collected
      together and feasted in the great hall of the palace, after which the
      royal children&mdash;of whom there were then three&mdash;were weighed, and
      silver coin placed in the balance was distributed among the destitute
      individuals present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year the threatened war between England and Scotland was
      averted by a contract of marriage between the infant Princess Margaret of
      England and the heir of Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      England was in such a dreadful state of misrule at this time that no
      traveller was safe from plunder; and in some counties no jury dared to
      punish the plunderer. Henry himself sat on the bench of justice and tried
      many cases. Once he summoned Lord Clifford for some offence, but the
      gentleman not only refused to answer, but forced the king's officers to
      eat the royal warrant, seal and all. He was severely punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      One great cause of Eleanor's unpopularity was the means <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link146" id="link146">146</a></span>she employed
      for extorting money from her subjects. She compelled vessels carrying
      valuable cargoes to unload at her quay, no matter how inconvenient it
      might be, in order that she might receive the toll. When the royal funds
      were almost exhausted, the king and queen, with their son, Prince Edward,
      daily invited themselves to dine with the different rich men of London in
      turn, to save the expense of keeping up a table of their own. They added
      to this economical mode of living by insisting on costly presents from
      their entertainers as a proof of loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1251.</span> The year 1251 closed with the
      marriage of the Princess Margaret and Alexander III. of Scotland, whose
      engagement had been signed seven years before. As the bride was just ten
      years of age, and the groom twelve, they probably had not much choice in
      this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning preceding the ceremony, the youthful groom was knighted at
      York Cathedral. The wedding feast was served by the archbishop at a cost
      of four thousand marks; and he supplied six hundred oxen, that were all
      consumed at one meal. The costumes worn by the nobility were, as when
      Eleanor, her mother, was married, of the most extravagant material,
      scolloped, embroidered and ornamented with costly jewels. The queen and
      her ladies wore robes that trailed on the ground, but, as they were the
      same length all around, they had to be held up to enable the wearers to
      walk. The height at which they were raised depended upon the beauty or
      ugliness of the feet and ankles, no doubt. During this reign the hair was
      gathered under a network of gold, over which was usually thrown a gauze
      veil. Unmarried ladies wore ringlets, or long braids hanging down the back
      and fastened with ribbons. A head-dress made in the shape of a knight's
      helmet, with an aperture for the face to peep through, was

    </p>
    <p>
      After Margaret's marriage, the king became even more extortionate in his
      demands for money than ever, and thus made a host of enemies. He applied
      for funds for a crusade, but was refused, and shortly after he was called
      upon to quell an insurrection at Guienne. This was the result of the
      recall of the Earl of Leicester, who had been governor there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl had been replaced by Prince Edward, who was only fourteen, and
      therefore incapable of managing public affairs. Before his departure, King
      Henry appointed Eleanor regent of England, but requested her to advise
      with his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, on matters of importance. He
      sailed from Portsmouth August 6, and arrived at Bordeaux on the 15th of
      the same month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Eleanor's first act, on finding herself in power, was to tax the
      London citizens more heavily than her husband had ever done, and those who
      refused her unjust claims were sent to the Marshalsea Prison. This conduct
      aroused universal indignation, and the following year, when parliament was
      summoned for the purpose of demanding aid to carry on the war in Gascony,
      they peremptorily declined to give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every other means having failed, Henry instructed his brother to extort
      money from the Jews, and no sooner did he get it than he sent for Eleanor
      to help him to squander it on the nuptials of Princess Eleanor of Castile
      with their eldest son, Prince Edward. Queen Eleanor willingly resigned the
      cares of government to the Earl of Cornwall, and with his wife, Prince
      Edmund, her second son, and a retinue of knights and ladies, sailed for
      Bordeaux, where she was warmly welcomed by her husband.

      <span class="side">A.D. 1255.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link150" id="link150">150</a></span>After Prince Edward's marriage,
      his parents went to pass a fortnight at the court of King Louis. The day
      after their arrival, King Henry distributed so much money among the poor
      of Paris and gave such a grand entertainment to the crowned heads
      assembled to meet him, that it was called the Feast of Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return home, which occurred January 27, 1255, the king and queen
      made a public entry into the city of London, and received a present of a
      hundred pounds and a valuable piece of plate from the citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, the royal couple were made extremely anxious by a report
      that the young king and queen of Scots were deprived of their rights and
      kept in close confinement by the regents, Sir John Baliol and Comyns. The
      queen's physician was immediately despatched to Scotland to ascertain the
      facts. He managed to obtain a secret interview with Margaret, who gave a
      lamentable account of her treatment. She said, "that she had been rudely
      torn from her husband and shut up in a dismal place, the dampness of which
      had seriously injured her health, and, so far from having any share in the
      government, she and he were treated with disrespect and were in danger of
      their lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Eleanor was so distressed at the condition of her child, that she
      accompanied the king on a northern campaign, constantly urging him to do
      something to aid her. The Earl of Gloucester was sent to Scotland for that
      purpose, and with John Mansel gained admittance to Edinburgh castle, by
      disguising themselves in the dress of Baliol's tenants. Then, secretly
      admitting their followers, they surprised the garrison, restored the young
      king and queen to each other's society and carried their cruel jailers,
      Baliol and Ross, before King Henry at Alnwick. Throwing themselves at the
      feet of the sovereign, the traitors implored for mercy and were forgiven,
      but as Baliol

      Margaret, with the young king of Scotland, to join her without delay. They
      obeyed, and as soon as the royal mother was convalescent, accompanied her
      to Woodstock, where King Henry joined them. The court was kept with
      extraordinary splendor at that beautiful palace, which contained three
      kings and three queens, with their retinues, during the winter of 1255,
      for besides the English and the Scottish royal couples, there was Richard,
      Earl of Cornwall, who had been elected King of the Romans, and his second

      and royal robes, and the entire populace <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link154" id="link154">154</a></span>assembled to witness the
      splendid procession. After the departure of the royal visitors, there was
      a season of misery and gloom caused by a dreadful famine, and by the drain
      that had been made on the public treasury by the King and Queen of the
      Romans, who, on departing for Aix-la-Chapelle, where they were to be
      crowned, carried with them seven hundred thousand pounds sterling. Added
      to this were the battles of the barons, to whom both Henry and Eleanor had
      made themselves obnoxious by frequent acts of selfishness and injustice,
      and finally the shameful attack upon the Jews, whose wealth had excited
      the envy of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mob was led on by the Marshal of London and John Fitz-John, a powerful
      baron, killing and plundering without mercy, men, women and children of
      that noble race, and driving hundreds from their beds into the street half
      clad as they were. The next morning they began again with such demoniacal
      yells that the queen, who was at the Tower, was so terrified that she got
      into her barge with several of her ladies, intending to escape to Windsor
      Castle. But as soon as the populace observed the royal barge, they made a
      rush for the bridge, crying: "Drown the witch!&mdash;drown the witch!" at
      the same pelting the queen with mud and trying to sink the vessel by
      hurling down huge blocks of wood and stone that they tore from the
      unfinished bridge. There was nothing for Eleanor to do but to hasten back
      to the Tower, where she remained until nightfall, then sought shelter in
      the Bishop of London's palace at St. Paul's, whence she was privately
      removed to Windsor Castle, where Prince Edward was garrisoned with his
      troops.

      <span class="side">A.D. 1264.</span> While the civil war continued King

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link157" id="link157">157</a></span>At the
      battle of Lewes, the king and Prince Edward were captured and locked up in
      the Castle of Wallingford. As soon as Eleanor heard their sad fate she
      sent word to Sir Warren de Basingbourne, her son's favorite knight, that
      Wallingford was feebly guarded and could not resist an attack. Sir Warren
      lost no time in crossing the country with three hundred horsemen, and laid
      siege to the castle, which, contrary to his expectation, was warmly
      defended. At last the besiegers called out to Sir Warren that "if they
      wanted Prince Edward, they should have him bound hand and foot, and shot
      from the mangonel"&mdash;a war engine used for throwing stones. On hearing
      this, the prince begged leave to speak with his friends, and appearing on
      the wall "assured them that if they persevered in the siege, he should be
      destroyed." Thereupon Sir Warren and his chevaliers withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal prisoners were afterwards removed to Kenilworth Castle, and Lady
      Maud Mortimer, who was warmly attached to the queen, helped Prince Edward
      to escape. Having sent him the necessary instructions, she had a swift
      horse concealed in a thicket on a certain day when it was planned that he
      was to ride races with his attendants. When all the horses were tired out,
      he approached the spot where Lady Maud's fresh one awaited him, and after
      mounting, he turned to his guard and said: "Commend me to my sire, the
      king, and tell him I shall soon be at liberty." He then galloped off to a
      hill, about a mile distant, where a band of armed knights awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the queen was living in France at this time, she made several
      secret visits to England, to ascertain the true state of affairs there.
      After her husband's dreadful defeat at Lewes, she pawned all her jewels,
      and, with the money thus raised, collected a powerful army that might have
      subdued the whole kingdom if they had ever reached <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link158" id="link158">158</a></span>it. But the Almighty mercifully
      ordained otherwise, and before Queen Eleanor, with her foreign troops, set
      sail, the battle of Evesham was fought and won by Prince Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1265.</span> At this battle King Henry was wounded
      in the shoulder and would have been cut down by one of his own soldiers,
      who mistook him for an enemy, had he not cried out in a feeble voice:
      "Slay me not, I am Henry of Winchester, your king."
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer who happened to be within hearing, conducted him to Prince
      Edward, and thus the royal father and son met once more. After tenderly
      embracing his sire, the prince knelt to receive his blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A succession of victories for Edward soon put an end to the barons' wars
      and reinstated the royal family of England. It is much to the credit of
      King Henry, that after he was restored to power, not one of his enemies
      was brought to the scaffold. But he punished them with such heavy fines
      that many of the rebel barons were reduced to penury.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1269.</span> Henry III. lived to witness the
      completion of St. Edward's chapel at Westminster, which he had begun fifty
      years before. On St. Edward's day, October 13, 1269, assisted by his two
      sons and his brother, the King of the Romans, he bore the bier of Edward
      the Confessor to the chapel and deposited it in the new receptacle. This
      ceremony was witnessed by the whole court, and Queen Eleanor offered at
      the shrine a silver image of the Virgin, besides jewels of great value.
      King Henry reserved the old coffin of the saint for his own use, and was
      placed in it just three years later, having expired on the 16th of
      November, 1272.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was buried at Westminster Abbey, near the shrine of Edward the
      Confessor. His funeral was conducted with <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link159" id="link159">159</a></span>great magnificence by the
      Knights Templars-military monks who, in the middle ages, acted as bankers
      and money-brokers to all Europe&mdash;and they raised a fine monument to
      his memory, which was afterwards inlaid with precious stones brought from
      the Holy Land for that purpose, by Edward I., King Henry's heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Margaret, of Scotland, followed her royal father to the grave within
      the year, and then, bowed down with suffering and sorrow, Queen Eleanor
      retired to Ambresbury, where four years later she entered the convent and
      took the veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1291.</span> She survived her husband nineteen
      years, and when she died her body was embalmed and placed in a vault until
      King Edward, her son, returned from his campaign in Scotland. Then he
      summoned all his barons and clergy to Ambresbury, where the funeral rites
      were duly performed and his mother's body was buried. Her heart was
      conveyed to London and interred in a church.

      CHAPTER X. ELEANORA OF CASTILE, FIRST QUEEN OF EDWARD I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1244-1291).
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>dward I. was only
      fifteen years old when he accompanied his mother across the Pyrenees from
      Bordeaux, to claim the hand of Eleanora, sister to King Alphonso of
      Castile, to whom he had been betrothed several months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1256.</span> The marriage was solemnized a few
      days, after his arrival, feasts and tournaments in honor of the event
      followed, and then the little bride of ten years proceeded with her lord
      to Paris. She was present at the feast of kings, given by King Henry to
      celebrate his son's marriage, of which mention is made in the preceding
      reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry III. and Queen Eleanor returned to England, the young couple
      went with them and made their public entry into the metropolis in grand
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the numerous entertainments given to welcome the bride, that which
      took place at the house of John Mansel, the secretary of state, was the
      most remarkable. All the royal family, with their entire retinue, were
      present, and as the mansion was by no means capacious enough to
      accommodate so large a party, tents were erected on the surrounding
      grounds. Considering that seven hundred messes of meat were served at one
      meal, it is not surprising that Mansel's house was too small.

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link163" id="link163">163</a></span>A few
      months later, Prince Edward took his little wife to Bordeaux to complete
      her education, which had scarcely begun at the time of her marriage. While
      she pursued her studies, the prince led the life of a knight-errant,
      wandering from place to place, and taking part in various tilting matches
      and tournaments until summoned to England to take part in the civil wars
      that resulted, after several years, in the complete restoration of Henry
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1265.</span> Peace was so far established in 1265
      as to warrant the return of Queen Eleanor, who took her daughter-in-law
      home with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Edward met the ladies at Dover, and was delighted to welcome his
      wife, who had, during her absence, developed into a remarkably handsome
      woman. She had clear cut, delicate features, a fine figure, and
      magnificent black hair, peculiar to Spanish ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young couple set up their establishment at the palace of Savoy, built
      by Edward's uncle, but passed much of their time at Windsor Castle, where,
      a year later, their first son was born. He received the name of John,
      after his unworthy grandfather. In 1267 a second son was born and named
      Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Edward was too restless a man and too much of a soldier to settle
      down to a life of luxury and ease, and an escape from injury, or perhaps
      death, that he had one day when playing chess at Windsor, turned his
      thoughts towards a crusade. He had just left the table, with no special
      purpose, when the centre stone of the ceiling fell and crushed the chair
      he had occupied. This circumstance convinced him that he was under Divine
      protection and that his life was spared for some great work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore began his preparations for a campaign in Syria forthwith.
      Prince Edward was eminently fitted for a crusader, being a powerful man,
      tall, well formed, remarkably <span class="pagenum"><a name="link164"
      id="link164">164</a></span>agile in wielding his sword, and an excellent
      horseman.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife loved him so fondly that she resolved to accompany him, though it
      was a sacrifice to leave her two lovely little boys. All the hardships and
      dangers attendant upon a crusade were laid before Eleanora in graphic
      colors, but she was willing to brave them all rather than let her husband
      go without her. "Nothing," said this faithful wife, "ought to part those
      whom God hath joined, and the way to heaven is as near, if not nearer,
      from Syria as from England or my native Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving England, Eleanora, in company with Queen Eleanor, visited
      the various shrines throughout the kingdom and made offerings, some of
      them being of great value.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1270.</span> In the spring of 1270 the young
      couple bade farewell to the two sons they were never to see again, and set
      sail for Bordeaux, thence to Sicily, where they were to be joined by King
      Louis of France, with his army.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the death of King Louis occurring at this time, deprived Prince Edward
      of the aid he had counted on, and caused his detention for several months.
      The King of Sicily tried to persuade him to abandon the crusade, but
      heroically striking his breast the prince exclaimed:&mdash;"<i>Sang de
      Dieu</i>, if all should desert me, I would lay siege to Acre, if only
      attended by Fowen my groom!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring and summer of 1271 Edward made two successful campaigns and
      defeated the Saracens with great slaughter. Returning to Cyprus for
      reinforcements, he undertook the siege of Acre, and established a
      reputation in the Holy Land, not inferior to that of his great uncle, Cour
      de Lion.

      The Saracen admiral, bent on revenge, sent a messen-

    <p>
      ger <span class="pagenum"><a name="link167" id="link167">167</a></span>several
      times to the prince, with letters, in which he expressed his desire to
      become a Christian convert. He was always received in private, because the
      admiral's life would be in danger from his own people unless the utmost
      secrecy were observed. The fifth time the ambassador presented himself,
      Edward was lying on a lounge, clad in a loose garment, as the weather was
      very warm. He was soon absorbed in the letters that had been written on
      purpose to please him. Suddenly the letter-carrier drew forth a poniard
      and aimed at the prince, who fortunately perceived the treachery in time
      to receive the blow on his arm. The man made another attempt, but Edward
      felled him to the ground with a powerful kick in the breast, then seizing
      a stool, killed him outright. The sound of the scuffle brought in Prince
      Edward's attendants, one of whom beat out the brains of the treacherous
      messenger. "What was the use of striking a dead man?" asked the prince,
      with stern reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A surgical operation became necessary before the wounded arm could be
      cured, but at the end of a fortnight Edward was able to mount his horse,
      the attention and good nursing of his wife having hastened his recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora had a little princess soon afterward, and called her Joanna of
      Acre, from the place of her birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As his army had become much reduced, Prince Edward took leave of the Holy
      Land and returned to Sicily with his wife and infant. Sad news awaited
      them, for a messenger announced the death of their two little boys in
      England, and they had scarcely recovered from the shock when another
      arrived to inform them that Henry III. also had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firmness and resignation with which Edward had borne the loss of his
      sons now gave way to an outburst of grief that surprised every one,
      particularly as his father's death made him King of England. When
      questioned on <span class="pagenum"><a name="link168" id="link168">168</a></span>the
      subject Edward replied: "The loss of infants may be repaired by the same
      God that gave them, but when a man has lost a good father it is not in the
      course of nature for God to send him another."
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal pair spent a year in Rome before returning to England. During
      their passage through France, Edward took part in several tournaments, and
      did not land at Dover with his wife until August 2, 1273.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1273.</span> Preparations for their coronation
      were speedily concluded, and that important ceremony took place on the
      19th of August. Great enthusiasm was exhibited by the citizens of London,
      who had enjoyed a season of such prosperity since the establishment of
      peace that they were anxious to prove their loyalty to the new king and
      queen by lavish expenditure. Both houses of parliament assembled to
      welcome their majesties, and for two weeks after the coronation banquets
      were served every day in the wooden buildings that had been erected in the
      palace grounds for that purpose. The rich and the poor, the country yeoman
      and the Londoner, were welcomed alike and entertained free of charge. It
      was a fortnight of universal rejoicing, and the opening reign promised to
      be an exceedingly popular one. But the most remarkable feature of the
      coronation was this: while the king was at a feast prepared in the palace
      for the lords who had attended him during the ceremony, King Alexander of
      Scotland came to pay his respects, accompanied by a hundred knights. They
      arrived on horseback, and, as each man alighted, his horse was turned
      loose to become the property of any person, no matter what his station,
      who might be lucky enough to capture him. Afterwards came Edmund, the
      king's brother, the Earls of Pembroke and Warren, with their train of
      knights, and the horses of this whole party were likewise turned loose.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link169" id="link169">169</a></span>Llewellyn,
      the Prince of Wales, did not appear at the coronation, and this displeased
      the king so much that he sent to inquire into the cause, whereupon the
      prince replied that as he had reconquered all the Welsh territory that
      Edward's Norman predecessors had taken possession of, he owed no homage to
      the King of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when Llewellyn's bride was on her way to Wales, her vessel was
      captured by the Bristol merchantmen, and the damsel was taken prisoner.
      King Edward treated her with courtesy, and placed her in charge of the
      queen at Windsor Castle. Then the prince submitted to the required homage
      with alacrity and went to Worcester, where the King and Queen of England
      met him, bringing his lady love with them. The marriage ceremony was
      performed at Worcester Cathedral; King Edward gave the bride away, the
      queen supported her at the altar, and both honored the marriage feast with
      their presence. A year later the young princess died, then her husband
      repented of his homage and suddenly invaded England, but he was killed on
      the battle-field without accomplishing anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1283.</span> Wales was in such an unsettled state
      in 1283 that King Edward found his presence there very necessary. The
      queen went with him and established her court at Rhuddlan Castle. By that
      time the royal couple had several children, and their sixth daughter,
      Princess Isabella, was born soon after their arrival in Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year the queen removed to the Castle of Caernarvon, because
      it was the strongest fortress in Wales, and the king wanted to feel that
      she was safe from insurgents. There, in a gloomy little chamber, ten feet
      by eight, a prince was born on the 25th of April, 1284. The room had no
      fireplace, but tapestry was hung on the walls to keep out draughts. It was
      Queen Eleanora who first <span class="pagenum"><a name="link170"
      id="link170">170</a></span>put tapestry to this use in England in
      imitation of a Moorish custom that she had seen adopted in Spain. A Welsh
      nurse was procured for the infant, because the queen knew that it would
      please the people to have a native woman in that position. Edward I. was
      at Rhud-dlan Castle, trying to negotiate a treaty of peace with the
      authorities of Wales, when a gentleman arrived to inform him of the birth
      of his son. He was so delighted that he knighted the man on the spot and
      made him a present of some lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king then hastened to Caernarvon to see his wife and baby. Three days
      later all the chiefs from the different parts of North Wales met at the
      castle to tender their submission to Edward, and to implore him to appoint
      them a prince of their own land, whose native tongue was neither French
      nor Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward assured them that he would comply, whereupon they promised that if
      his character was free from stain, they would certainly accept him without
      a murmur. Then the king ordered his infant son to be brought in, and
      presenting him to the assembly, said, "that he was a native of their
      country, his character was without reproach, that he could not speak a
      word of English or French, and that if they pleased, the first words he
      uttered should be Welsh."
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no alternative, the rough mountaineers kissed the little hand
      and swore fealty to Edward of Caernarvon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen soon removed to Conway Castle, where she was surrounded with all
      the comforts and luxuries the age afforded. Under her influence the Welsh
      made rapid strides towards civilization, and she felt happy to be among
      them; but they had been so barbarous when she first went to their country
      that the king had to threaten se-

      the nobles of Scotland, solemnly betrothed to little Edward of Caernarvon,
      Prince of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1290, Queen Eleanora was the mother of nine beautiful princesses, to
      whose care and education she devoted a great deal of time. They occupied a
      retired portion of Westminster Palace, which was called in consequence,
      Maiden Hall. One of these princesses entered a convent, not long after the
      ninth one was born, and during the same year three others married. The
      rejoicings that attended the nuptial ceremonies were suddenly brought to a
      close by a dreadful calamity. It had been arranged that the little Queen
      Margaret of Scotland should go to England to be educated under the
      guidance of Queen Eleanora, but she died on the voyage. This sad event was
      disastrous to Scotland, and threatened the prosperity of the whole
      kingdom, by severing the bond that would have united it had the marriage
      between Margaret and Edward been consummated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1291.</span> As soon as the king heard of
      Margaret's death he started for Scotland, bidding his beloved Eleanora to
      follow as speedily as possible. But before he reached his destination a
      messenger overtook him with news of the queen's dangerous illness. She had
      been attacked with fever while travelling through Lincolnshire, and
      prevented from proceeding. Edward turned back instantly, and everything
      was lost sight of excepting that his dear wife was ill and suffering.
      Notwithstanding that he pushed forward with utmost haste, he arrived too
      late, for the queen was dead. King Edward's grief was so deep for a time
      that he was unable to attend to public affairs of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link174" id="link174">174</a></span>any description. He followed the
      corpse of his wife for thirteen days, stopping at every important town to
      have a funeral ceremony performed at the largest church where all the
      neighboring priests and monks assembled for the purpose. As the royal bier
      approached London the officers and principal citizens met it, clad in
      black hoods and gowns, and marched in solemn procession to Westminster
      Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Eleanora was buried at the feet of her royal father-in-law. Besides
      the beautiful monument in bronze for which King Edward paid an Italian
      artist £1700, he erected others in the shape of a cross in memory of the
      <i>chère reine</i>, as he called his wife, at each of the places where the
      funeral procession halted on the way to London. The last stopping place
      was the one now called Charing Cross, a perversion of the original French,
      which signified "dear queen's cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      Eleanora of Castile was sincerely lamented in England; for as Walsingham
      says of her: "To our nation, she was a living mother, the column and
      pillar of the whole realm. She was a godly, modest and merciful princess,
      who consoled the sorrow-stricken, and made those friends that were at
      discord."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the reign of Edward I. and Eleanora, sculpture, architecture,
      casting in brass and bronze, and wood-carving were encouraged, and many
      beautiful specimens of these branches of art appeared in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the children of this royal couple, the nun-princess and Edward II.
      were the only ones that reached middle age.

      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MARGUERITE OF FRANCE, SECOND QUEEN OF EDWARD I.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1282-1317.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ing Edward I. was
      so grieved at the death of his "<i>chère reine</i>," that he gave himself
      up to the deepest melancholy, which lasted several months. He was growing
      old, and felt the loss of his companion of many years most keenly.
      However, he learned in time to submit to the inevitable, and roused
      himself to attend to the affairs of his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner did his ministers observe this favorable change in the mind of
      their monarch than they set to work to effect further improvement by
      seeking a successor to the defunct queen. Their choice fell on Marguerite,
      the sister of Philip le Bel of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A. D. 1299.</span> After the usual preliminaries the
      treaty was duly signed, and the marriage was celebrated at Canterbury,
      Sept. 8, 1299.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite was only seventeen years old, but she was such a good, sedate
      and pious woman that her union with a man old enough to be her grandfather
      proved by no means an unhappy one. On the contrary, she exercised a
      wholesome influence over him, and prompted him to many merciful and worthy
      actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due to her persuasion that the poor widow, Lady Marguerite Howard,
      was released from a debt to the crown which she could not possibly have
      paid, and many of her subjects could cite similar acts prompted by her
      good and tender heart. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link176" id="link176">176</a></span>The
      citizens of Winchester were deeply indebted to her for preserving them
      from King Henry's wrath when Bernard Pereres, a hostage from the city of
      Bayonne, made his escape. He had been confided to the care of the mayor of
      Winchester, and was looked upon as a prisoner of the greatest importance.
      King Edward placed a sheriff in charge of the city, deprived the people of
      all their liberties, fined the mayor three hundred marks, and shut him up
      in the Marshalsea prison until he should be able to pay the sum. The
      Winchester citizens were in despair, and threw themselves on the mercy of
      their queen. She recalled the exhibition of loyalty that they had made
      when she appeared among them a bride, and her heart warmed towards them in
      their distress. Fortunately, she was able to aid them, for the king had
      presented her with the charter of Winchester, thus entitling her to all
      the fines levied on its citizens. With this document she presented herself
      before her lord, and claimed the unfortunate mayor with his three hundred
      marks, as her property. Edward yielded, and even restored the liberties of
      which he had, in his displeasure, deprived the Winchester people. They
      never ceased to be grateful to Queen Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this occurred after she had been Edward's wife several years. We must
      return to the beginning of her reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Wednesday after his marriage, the king was suddenly and
      unexpectedly summoned to Scotland because of a rebellion that had broken
      out there. During his absence the queen occupied apartments in the Tower,
      and as the small-pox was raging in London that season, her court were
      quarantined in that palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year she joined the king in Scotland, but stopped at
      Brotherton in Yorkshire while he was fighting his battles.

      born. It was a boy, and Queen Marguerite gave him the name of Thomas,
      after the favorite English saint, Thomas à Becket of Canterbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen occupied Cawood Castle at that time, and during the four years
      she spent in that magnificent fortress, her husband was laying siege to
      one stronghold after another, until Scotland was subdued from sea to sea.
      Stirling Castle was the last one to yield, but when King Edward made his
      triumphal journey home to England, its brave commander, Wallace, was
      carried a captive in the royal train.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return to London, the king and queen gave a series of
      entertainments to celebrate the conquest of Scotland. One of the grandest
      tournaments ever witnessed in England took place at that time, at
      Westminster Palace, on which occasion Prince Edward and two hundred other
      noblemen were knighted. In 1308 the queen had another son. She named him
      Edmund, and he afterward became the Earl of Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A. D. 1308.</span> King Edward was on his way to
      Scotland in 1308, but fell ill before he reached the border. He lingered
      until the Prince of Wales reached him, and with his dying breath commanded
      his son, "to be kind to his little brothers, and, above all, to treat with
      respect and tenderness his mother, Queen Marguerite."
    </p>
    <p>
      Much sorrow was felt at the death of their warrior king, but his wife
      mourned for the loss of the tender, affectionate husband Edward had always
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months after his death she went to France to be present at the
      marriage of Edward II., with her niece, Isabella. On her return to England
      she lived in seclusion, devoting her time and money to deeds of charity.
      Marguerite died on the 14th of February, 1317, at the early age of
      thirty-six, and was buried at the Grey Friars church, a splendid building
      that she had founded.

      <span class="side">A. D. 1317.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a

      always loved her, and to show his respect for her memory, he not only had
      her pall draped with rich material of silk striped with gold, but erected
      a splendid monument besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Marguerite is the ancestress of all the English nobility bearing the
      name of Howard, who unite in their veins the blood of St. Louis with the
      greatest of the Plantagenet kings.

      CHAPTER XII. ISABELLA OF FRANCE, QUEEN OF EDWARD II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1295-1358.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>sabella of France
      was a princess of the very highest rank, her father being Philip IV. of
      France, and her mother Queen of Navarre. But she was likewise one of the
      worst women that ever occupied the throne of England. She was born in
      1295, and when only nine years of age was betrothed to Edward, Prince of
      Wales. At that time her father agreed to settle on her the sum of £18,000
      for her marriage portion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not rich enough to give her so much money, but he got possession of
      it by murdering and robbing the poor Knights Templars&mdash;a religious
      body first established at Jerusalem to protect pilgrims travelling in the
      Holy Land. Such ill-gotten gain could not be expected to bestow much
      pleasure or profit on the possessor of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edward I. was dying, he charged his son to lose no time in completing
      the arrangements for his marriage, and the prince had received such
      favorable reports concerning the personal charms of his lady-love that he
      hastened to obey. Before the king was buried he dispatched two earls to
      France to appoint the wedding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so much in love, that it is said he lost the kingdom of Scotland by
      hurrying away to get married when his presence in that country would have
      made him its sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      He need not have been in such haste, for Isabella was scarcely fourteen
      years of age, and perhaps if he had waited <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link182" id="link182">182</a></span>until her mind was more matured,
      she would not have acted so unwisely as she did on several occasions
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grand preparations were made at Westminster Palace for the reception of
      the young queen. The royal apartments were re-decorated and handsomely
      furnished, the gardens were newly laid out and planted with the rarest
      flowers, the fish-ponds were all cleaned out and freshly supplied, and
      Queen's Bridge was repaired. The royal ship called Margaret of Westminster
      was cleaned, painted, and newly fitted up under the king's personal
      direction for the comfort of his expected bride, and no trouble or expense
      was spared that could add to her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everything was ready, Edward appointed his favorite, Piers Gaveston,
      guardian of the country, and sailed, accompanied by Queen Marguerite, his
      stepmother, to meet his bride. He landed at Boulogne, where Isabella and
      her royal parents awaited him, and the next day the marriage was
      celebrated at the famous cathedral of that town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A. D. 1308.</span> Four kings and four queens were
      present, besides a larger number of princes and nobility than had ever met
      together on such an occasion, and the church presented an appearance of
      unusual magnificence. The bride's beauty excited the greatest admiration,
      and she was called Isabella the Fair. Had any member of that royal
      assembly been told that before the end of her life she would be known as
      the "She-wolf of France," he would not have believed it; appearances are
      often deceptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Festivities were kept up for nearly two weeks, then the newly-wedded
      couple went to Dover, where they were met by a large party of noble ladies
      and gentlemen who attended them to Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who met them on their arrival in England was the Piers
      Gaveston whom Edward had left as guardian during his absence. This man was
      the cause of a great <span class="pagenum"><a name="link183" id="link183">183</a></span>

      deal of trouble later because of his unbounded influence over the king,
      who, the moment he caught sight of his favorite, flew to him and threw his
      arms about his neck calling him "brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella's outfit was magnificent. She had two superb solid gold crowns
      ornamented with precious stones, a large number of gold and silver
      drinking vessels, golden spoons, fifty silver soup-bowls, twelve large
      silver dishes, and twelve smaller ones. Her dresses were made of gold and
      silver stuff, velvet, and shot silk. Six of them were of the finest
      imported green cloth, six were of mixed and figured material, and six were
      scarlet; she had, besides, a supply of costly furs, four hundred and
      nineteen yards of towels, and six dozen nightcaps. She brought with her
      the tapestry for her own chamber, on which were embroidered in gold the
      arms of France, England, and Brabant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father presented his son-in-law with a large number of the costliest
      rings, jewels, and other precious articles that could be found; but Edward
      was foolish enough to give all to Piers Gaveston, who had a perfect
      passion for finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such conduct on the part of her husband made Isabella very angry, for she
      looked upon these handsome gifts from her father as part of her dowry, and
      naturally she objected very decidedly to having them handed over to a
      stranger whom she had already begun to dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a month after the marriage the day was appointed for the coronation
      of the young king and queen, but the nobles informed Edward that unless
      his haughty favorite were banished from court they would not attend the
      ceremony. This threat signified that they meant to refuse their oath of
      allegiance, so Edward was very much alarmed, but promised that at the
      parliament, which was to meet immediately after the coronation, everything
      should be arranged <span class="pagenum"><a name="link186" id="link186">186</a></span>to
      their entire satisfaction. But he gave fresh cause for complaint by
      bestowing upon Piers Gaveston the very highest office at the coronation,&mdash;that
      of bearing the St. Edward's crown. This made one of the royal earls so
      angry that he would have killed the favorite on the spot had it not been
      for the respect he felt for the young queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaveston had taken it upon himself to manage everything; and either his
      arrangements were badly made, or he was so unpopular, that nobody would
      obey him, for there was nothing but disorder and confusion from beginning
      to end. The crowd was so great that several people were injured, and one
      poor knight was knocked down and trodden to death. It was three o'clock in
      the afternoon before the coronation was over, and since early morning
      those engaged in the ceremonies had eaten nothing. The company were not
      seated at the banquet until after dark, and then every dish was so poorly
      cooked and so badly served that the hungry nobles were indignant, and felt
      that they could sooner have forgiven the favorite for any offence than
      this one. Isabella, too, was out of humor and exhausted; in short, all
      classes were dissatisfied, and many of the customary ceremonies had to be
      omitted because the usual masters of them were absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether by accident or design, several slights were put upon the young
      queen that made her French followers so angry that they went back home and
      complained to her father. Besides, Isabella sent a letter filled with
      complaints against her husband and his too-powerful favorite. This made
      the King of France use all his influence to strengthen the party of French
      barons who despised Gaveston, and even to induce the English ones to
      oppose him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably, if the queen had been older, her beauty and talents might have
      enabled her to gain such control over <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link187" id="link187">187</a></span>her husband that his favorite's
      presence would have had less effect; but she was so young and
      inexperienced that, although <i>she</i> felt the importance of her
      position in the English court, Edward treated her like a child, and this
      vexed her beyond everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaveston was just the sort of a person who could, if he chose, lead so
      weak a young man as Edward II., and, unfortunately, he did so choose. He
      was very handsome, a perfect Adonis, remarkable for his courteous manners,
      courage, and sparkling wit. He would mimic and make fun of the
      peculiarities of the English nobles for the amusement of the thoughtless
      king, which was, of course, most displeasing to them, and he even went so
      far as to ridicule the queen. She complained to her father, who secretly
      induced the barons to insist upon the banishment of the favorite. Edward
      was at last compelled to yield, and promised to send him beyond the seas,
      but the wily Gaveston had recently strengthened his position by marrying a
      niece of the king, so he had himself appointed Governor of Ireland. Even
      his worst enemies own that he ruled that country very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the following year he came back to England to attend a tournament. He
      brought such a magnificent retinue, and made so great a display, that the
      barons were jealous, and hated him worse than ever. Little did their
      dislike or their displeasure affect him, for he took his revenge by
      ridiculing them anew, and calling them most provoking names. The Earl of
      Pembroke was dark, thin, and sallow-complexioned, so he named him "Joseph
      the Jew;" the Earl of Warwick, who foamed at the mouth when in a passion,
      was "the Wild Boar of Ardenne;" and the Earl of Lancaster, who dressed
      peculiarly, was styled "the<i> Stage Player</i>." Thus he made fun of the
      entire party. But the insults were treasured up against him; <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link188" id="link188">188</a></span>and when,
      some years later, his day of reckoning dawned, not much mercy was shown
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime he had stirred up such a storm that his royal master's
      throne tottered under him. The queen and her uncle, the Earl of Lancaster,
      with all the barons, formed a combination against him so strong that
      Edward dared not oppose it, and dismissed him to Guienne. At parting with
      his favorite, he lavished on him all his jewels, even the rings, brooches,
      and buckles that his young wife had presented him with at various times.
      This was one of the most foolish things Edward ever did, and nobody can
      blame Isabella for feeling offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she was at that time much beloved by her subjects, and, with
      Gaveston out of the way, we hear no more complaints until the year 1312,
      when, to her great displeasure, he turned up again. This time, with his
      usual lack of judgment, the king had recalled him, and made him his
      principal secretary of state. This was a very high office, for he had all
      the affairs of the country under his control, and so determined was he to
      keep Edward under his thumb that nobody could speak to him excepting
      through the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement gave great offence, and when the young queen saw how the
      royal favorite was injuring her husband by making the nation dislike him,
      and, what was still worse, by leading him into dissipation and other acts
      of folly, she angrily remonstrated with him. He forgot the respect due to
      her rank, and answered with contempt, whereupon she complained to the
      king. But instead of upholding his wife and punishing his insolent
      favorite, Edward treated the matter with the utmost indifference. Isabella
      was furious, and wrote to her father, the King of France, a letter filled
      with bitter complaints of her husband's coldness and neglect, saying,
      "that she was the most wretched of wives, and that Gaveston was the cause
      of all her troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply, Philip secretly urged the peers to rebel, which they did at
      last, headed by the Earl of Lancaster, and determined to compel Edward to
      dismiss his hated secretary of state. Then began a civil war, the most
      horrible disaster that can overtake any country. Edward, evidently
      considering discretion the better part of valor, ran away with his wife
      and his favorite. They got as far as York, but the victorious barons
      entered that place in triumph, and the two fugitives sailed for
      Scarborough, leaving the poor young queen alone, although she entreated
      her husband with tears in her eyes to take her along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding herself forsaken, Isabella retired to a remote castle, where she
      passed her time in visiting the sick and poor, which the following notes,
      found in the royal household book, prove:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1312.</span> "October 9. To little Thomeline, the
      Scotch orphan boy, to whom the queen, being moved to charity by his
      miseries, gave food and raiment to the amount of six and sixpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      And again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the same orphan, on his being sent to London to dwell with Agnes, the
      wife of Jean, the queen's French organist; for his education, for
      necessaries bought him, and for curing his maladies, fifty-two shillings
      and eightpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      While at this castle the queen received a message from her uncle Lancaster
      assuring her of her safety, and telling her that they were only fighting
      to get hold of Gaveston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, in the meantime, having left his favorite in the strong fortress
      of Scarborough, proceeded to the midland counties to raise forces for his
      defence. But the men of England were so indignant at the treatment their
      young <span class="pagenum"><a name="link190" id="link190">190</a></span>queen
      had received at the hands of her husband and his unworthy guide, that
      instead of obeying the orders they received, they rose <i>en masse</i> to
      storm Gaveston in his shelter. Being destitute of provisions, and knowing
      that he could not withstand a siege, he surrendered on condition that he
      was to be safely conducted to the king and allowed to speak with him
      freely before his trial.
    </p>

    <p>
      The barons, after solemnly swearing to observe this treaty, lost no time
      in bringing their prisoner to a sham trial. No mercy tempered their
      judgment of a man who had ridiculed and defied them, so they beheaded him
      then and there. Afterwards they enjoyed the extreme satisfaction of
      ransacking the luckless favorite's baggage, and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link191" id="link191">191</a></span>found many of the crown jewels,
      a number of precious ornaments that had been presented to the king, and
      several articles of gold and silver plate from the royal household.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Edward heard of the murder of his friend, he was beside himself with
      rage and grief, and swore vengeance on the heads of those who had
      committed the deed. He then joined the queen and went with her to Windsor,
      where their first child, afterwards Edward III., was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a fine healthy baby, and his parents, as well as the English
      nation, and the French nobles who were in the country were all delighted
      at this happy event. Four days after his birth the little fellow was
      baptized with great pomp, having no less than seven godfathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this period, Isabella's influence over her husband was so
      strengthened that she brought about a reconciliation between him and his
      barons, and there was peace in the realm once more. Then the king and
      queen made a pleasure trip to Paris, where they spent two months enjoying
      the feasts and amusements which the magnificent and wealthy court of
      Philip provided for their entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, through the entreaties of the queen, the pardon to all those who
      had assisted in causing the death of Gaveston was published, and her
      excellent influence was felt in many ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next few years another prince and a princess were born, and on
      each occasion presents of great value were distributed by the royal pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the household book there is mention of the king's gift of £333, "to
      Isabella, Queen of England, for the baptismal feast after the birth of the
      Lady Eleanora." There are also these entries, showing something of the
      fashions of the time:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="link192"
      id="link192">192</a></span>"<i>To Vanne Ballard, for pieces of silk and
      gold tissue of fustian and of flame-colored silk for the making of
      cushions for the charrettes (carriages) of the queen and her ladies</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>To Robert le Termor, the bootmaker of Fleet Street, for six pairs of
      boots with tassels of silk and drops of silver gilt, price of each pair
      five shillings, bought for the king's use</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the royal couple kept Twelfth Night their presents were very
      generous. To one of their subjects they gave a silver gilt pitcher with
      stand and cover; to another, for presenting bunches of new grapes, 10s.;
      to another, for bringing a box of rose-colored sugar, £2 10s.; to the
      mother of the king's fool, 10s., besides many others. To the Lady Mary,
      the king's sister, who was a nun, fifteen pieces of tapestry with
      coats-of-arms embroidered thereon, besides £26 on her departure from
      court, and to three of his knights for dragging him out of bed on Easter
      morning Edward paid £20.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1317.</span> During this fourteenth century there
      was the most dreadful famine ever known in England, which lasted nearly
      three years. On one occasion, when the king and queen were dining in
      public in the great hall of the palace at Westminster, a woman, wearing a
      mask, entered on horseback, rode straight up to the royal table, and
      handed a letter to the king. Thinking that it probably contained "some
      agreeable flattery", he ordered it to be read aloud. But, to his great
      mortification, it took him severely to task for his unkingly fancies, and
      blamed his bad government for all the calamities that had befallen the
      country. The woman was immediately arrested, and confessed that she had
      been employed by a certain knight. The person she named boldly
      acknowledged that he had written the letter, supposing that it would be
      read in private, and that the king would thus be informed of the
      complaints of his subjects.

      It was about four years after this event that the queen first met Roger
      Mortimer, the man who exercised such an influence over her life. By this
      time the king had two new favorites named Despencer. They were father and
      son, and both were bitter enemies to Roger Mortimer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances of Isabella's life so began to shape themselves at this
      period that from being a lovely, amiable peace-maker, she became a bad,
      cruel, dishonored traitor. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link194"
      id="link194">194</a></span>In 1321 she set out on a pilgrimage to the tomb
      of St Thomas à Becket, proposing to spend the night at Leeds Castle, which
      was her own property. Baron Badlesmere had charge, of this castle, and
      lived there with his wife, so Isabella sent a marshal in advance to have
      everything put in order for her reception, not imagining for a moment that
      any objection could possibly be raised to her stopping there. But the
      baron was absent from home, and had charged his wife to protect the castle
      from any intruders whatsoever. Not knowing what might be the real object
      of the queen's visit, Lady Badlesmere did just the wrong thing when the
      royal messengers arrived, treated them with insolence, and said, "that the
      queen might seek some other lodging, for she would admit nobody within the
      castle without an order from her lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger was still arguing the case with the lady when Isabella
      arrived at the castle gates with her train. A volley of arrows greeted the
      party, and killed six of the royal escort. The queen was obliged to seek
      other shelter for the night, but she was excessively angry, and complained
      bitterly to the king of the treatment she had received, begging him to
      avenge the insolence of Lady Badlesmere for daring to exclude her from her
      own castle. Badlesmere himself was foolish enough to send a most insulting
      letter to the queen in reply to the complaints that had been addressed to
      him concerning his wife's conduct, declaring that he heartily approved of
      what she had done. As this baron had held the high position of steward of
      the royal household before he was placed in charge of Leeds Castle, it is
      probable that the queen had done something to make him her enemy. Neither
      her Uncle Lancaster nor any of his associates seemed inclined to side with
      Isabella, so she determined to be revenged on them all, and would not rest
      until her husband promised to besiege the castle. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link195" id="link195">195</a></span>A large force was soon gathered
      together before the walls, but Lady Badlesmere felt certain that, with the
      stock of provisions she had laid in, she could resist any attack, besides
      she expected all the barons to side with her. But she soon found out her
      mistake, and in a few days the Castle of Leeds was obliged to surrender,
      and eleven of its defenders, including Badlesmere, were hanged just
      outside the gate. Lady Badlesmere was sent to the Tower of London as a
      state prisoner.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link196" id="link196">196</a></span>Isabella
      now did all in her power to influence the king against the barons, instead
      of working to restore peace, as she once did. So he fought against them in
      person, and Lancaster was seized in the battle. He was sentenced by the
      king with the least possible delay, and beheaded a few hours later. The
      queen knew nothing about her uncle's sentence until too late, otherwise,
      it is to be hoped, she would have endeavored to save him. She was living
      in the Tower at the time, and it was there that her youngest child, the
      Lady Joanna, was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger Mortimer had been captured while fighting against the king, and
      imprisoned in the Tower under sentence of death; but he managed in some
      unaccountable manner to see Isabella, and get her interested in him. Her
      influence was all-powerful at that period, so, to the astonishment of
      everybody, she made Edward change Mortimer's sentence of death to
      imprisonment for life, though he had really commenced the civil war by a
      fierce attack on the lands of the Despencers. These men now hated the
      queen more than ever for assisting their enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year Mortimer planned his escape from the Tower with the
      assistance of the constable and others. The queen herself provided a drink
      for the guard that put them into a heavy sleep. Then the prisoner, who had
      worked a hole from his dungeon into the kitchen of the royal apartments,
      climbed up the chimney and got out on the roof, along which he stealthily
      crawled to the Thames side, and descended by a rope ladder. The constable
      awaited him in a little boat, and rowed him across the river, where seven
      of his friends met him on horseback. With this guard he went to the coast
      of Hampshire, and pretended to sail to the Isle of Wight; but, instead of
      that, the fugitive got on board a large ship that had been engaged for
      him, and was soon landed in Normandy. Thence he went to Paris. When the
      king heard of the escape a great hue and cry was raised for Mortimer, dead
      or alive, but his whereabouts were not suspected, and he remained safely
      hidden in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Despencers now began to influence the king as powerfully as Gaveston
      had done, and the queen commenced her plans for their destruction. She
      declared that they were the cause of all the recent bloodshed, and
      pretended that her Uncle Lancaster was a saint and a martyr, who only met
      his death by the advice of these favorites.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had really committed one fault for which Isabella could not forgive
      them; they had caused her allowance to be curtailed, and no one ever
      offended her without paying dearly for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had ceased to be lovable to the king, and so had lost her hold on him;
      but for this also she blamed the Despencers. Then she was deprived, by
      their advice, of her French servants and of all her possessions in
      England. She and her husband quarrelled to such an extent that at last
      they refused to see each other at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Isabella was not meek enough to stand ill-treatment, so she complained
      to her brother, King Charles, who had succeeded to the throne of France.
      He wrote a very indignant letter to Edward, declaring his intention of
      seizing all the provinces of the French crown held by England. But Edward
      was not prepared for war, and neither he nor his ministers dared to go to
      France to face the angry brother of Isabella.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1325.</span> In this dilemma the queen volunteered
      her services as peace-maker, providing she might be allowed to go to Paris
      herself. Edward was only too happy to have the matter so easily settled,
      and the Despencers were delighted at the thought of getting rid of her.
      Isabella had a little plan of her own which she <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link198" id="link198">198</a></span>intended to carry out. The first
      step was a treaty of peace, which she arranged on her arrival in France,
      between her brother and the King of England. She was not at all surprised
      when the Despencers, who feared her influence over the weak mind of
      Edward, had dissuaded him from crossing the channel with her, even after
      his arrangements had been made. In fact, this was exactly what she had
      desired, because it enabled her to propose that her son, the Prince of
      Wales, should be invested with certain powers which she named, and sent in
      his father's stead. Both the king and the Despencers fell into the snare,
      and Isabella got the heir to the throne of England into her own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Isabella found herself safe in France with her son, she laughed
      in her sleeve at the way she had hoodwinked her husband and his despised
      favorites. She was just where she wanted to be, and had no intention of
      returning to England until affairs there had changed to her complete
      satisfaction. She and her brother, King Charles, had concocted a treaty,
      it is true, but it was so written as to be almost incomprehensible, and to
      leave much matter for dispute between the two sovereigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella made all sorts of frivolous excuses for prolonging her stay in
      Paris, where she was joined by her favorite Mortimer and all the banished
      English lords. Although these people were open enemies of her husband and
      his government, the wicked queen held councils and meetings with them,
      while she refused to have anything to do with the commissioners Edward had
      appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop of Exeter, horrified at her disgraceful behavior, went over to
      England to inform the king of it, and to advise him to command her
      immediate return with the Prince of Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward wrote several letters to his wife on this subject, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link199" id="link199">199</a></span>but she paid
      no attention either to his entreaties or his orders. She declared openly
      "that it was the intention of the Despencers to cause her to be put to
      death if she returned to England." She knew better, but this statement
      aided her schemes, and she even succeeded in deceiving her brother, King
      Charles of France, who wrote King Edward "that he could not permit her to
      return to him unless she were guaranteed from the evil that was meditated
      against her by her enemies, the Despencers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward's reply to this letter was manly and dignified. He begged his
      brother-in-law not to credit anything so false, but to send back his wife,
      of whom he wrote in kind, affectionate terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella refused to go, and used her vile influence to encourage her son's
      disobedience in this matter also. Edward II. was very much hurt, and wrote
      frequently to his wife, reminding her of her duty, and taking her severely
      to task for her disloyal conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that during this time Isabella was treacherous enough to write
      most friendly letters to Hugh Despencer, even though she had openly
      pronounced him her enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What offended King Edward most of all was that his son, whom he loved
      dearly, was not only kept away from him, but that he constantly associated
      with his mother's friend and adviser, Mortimer, who had proved himself a
      shameless, worthless traitor. Besides, Isabella had contracted a marriage
      between her son and a daughter of Count Hainault without the slightest
      mention of the matter to her husband, and had even gone so far as to
      receive the bride's marriage dowry, which was paid in advance, and used it
      for her own private expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward's touching appeals took effect at last on the heart of King
      Charles, who began to treat his sister coolly and to urge her return to
      England. But she had gone too <span class="pagenum"><a name="link200"
      id="link200">200</a></span>far to stop now, and her influence over her son
      was so great that she made him believe her life was in danger both at the
      hands of his father and the Despencers. The young man naturally felt that
      he must stay by his persecuted mother, and, if necessary, defend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward then applied to the Pope, who threatened to excommunicate King
      Charles if he did not immediately dismiss Isabella and her son from his
      dominions. The King of France was much alarmed at this threat, and did not
      hesitate to act upon it at once, particularly as he was so displeased with
      his sister that he had not spoken to her for a long time. He swore "that
      whoever should speak in behalf of his sister, the Queen of England, should
      forfeit his lands and be banished the realm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella had a cousin named Robert d'Artois, who was warmly attached to
      her. One night he woke her up to inform her of a conspiracy that he had
      just discovered to deliver her, the prince, the Earl of Kent, her
      husband's brother, and Mortimer over to King Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen was so alarmed that she did not know which way to turn. Robert
      advised her to go to Germany, and place herself under the protection of
      William, Earl of Hainault, whose wife was her cousin. This plan struck her
      favorably, and the next night she left Paris with Mortimer, her son, and
      the Earl of Kent who always sided with her against his brother, King
      Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some days they got into the country of Cambray, and lodged at the
      house of a poor knight, who received the party with great pleasure, and
      entertained them in the best possible manner. The Earl of Hainault was a
      good, kind-hearted man, and felt very sorry when he thought of the queen's
      being obliged to seek refuge in a foreign country, so he sent his young
      brother, Sir John, with a few other gentlemen, to pay his respects to
      Isabella and conduct

    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John, being filled with the spirit of a true knight-errant, burst into
      tears when he heard Isabella's sad complaints from her own lips. "Lady,"
      he said, "see here your knight who will not fail to die for you, though
      every one else should forsake you; therefore I will do everything in my
      power to conduct you safely to England with your son, and to restore you
      to your rank with the assistance of your friends in those parts; and I,
      and all those whom I can influence, will risk our lives on the adventure
      for your sake; and we shall have a sufficient armed force, if it please
      God, without fearing any danger from the King of France."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen would have thrown herself at his feet, but he would not allow
      it, and said, as he caught her in his arms:
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid that the Queen of England should do such a thing! Madam, be of
      good comfort to yourself and company, for I will keep my promise, and you
      shall come to see my brother and the countess, his wife, and all their
      fine children, who will be rejoiced to see you, for I have heard them say
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen answered: "Sir, I find in you more kindness and comfort than in
      all the world besides; and I give you five hundred thousand thanks for all
      you have promised with so much courtesy. I and my son shall be forever
      bound unto you, and we will put the kingdom of England under your
      management, as in justice it ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Isabella mounted her horse, and set off with her train to follow Sir
      John to Valenciennes. Many of the citizens of that town came forth to meet
      her, and she was received very graciously by the Earl of Hainault and his
      wife, who gave several feasts in her honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella spent a week in this hospitable household, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link204" id="link204">204</a></span>during which Sir John's
      sympathies were so aroused in her behalf that he obtained his brother's
      permission to accompany her to England. In the meantime he had written to
      certain knights in other parts of the country, beseeching them to arm in
      the cause of the distressed Queen of England. The expedition gathered at
      Dort, where the queen and her suite met them. Here they all embarked, but
      the fleet was tossed about by a tempest for several hours, and some of the
      ships were knocked to pieces. At last the queen was brought safely to
      shore near Harwich, and her knights and attendants built her a tent of
      carpets, and kindled a great fire of pieces of the wrecked vessels. Then
      all the horses and arms were taken from the ships which, the wind being
      favorable by that time, were sent around to the opposite coast. At
      daybreak the queen marched with her army to the next town, where she found
      the houses well stocked with all sorts of provisions, though the people
      had fled in terror, not knowing what to expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advanced guard, meantime, marched through the country, seizing all the
      cattle and food they could get hold of, and spreading misery in every
      direction. When Isabella came along the owners complained bitterly, but
      she paid them most liberally for all they had lost. The money thus
      distributed made the queen popular, and the people were anxious to supply
      her with whatever she desired after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the king had forbidden his subjects to meet Isabella, when she
      arrived at Harwich a large number of knights, barons, and bishops were
      assembled to welcome her. Her force numbered two thousand seven hundred
      and fifty-seven soldiers, commanded by Sir John of Hainault, and Roger
      Mortimer commanded the English, who joined them after, they landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many false stories had been circulated by the queen's agents of the
      persecutions she had endured from her hus<span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link205" id="link205">205</a></span>band and his barbarous
      ministers, and of the way she had been driven into a foreign land by plots
      against her life, that she was considered the most injured of wives and
      queens.

    <p>
      The common people were blinded by excitement, and flocked to meet her
      without stopping to inquire whether her cause were just or not. All the
      tales of her guilty conduct that had reached them from time to time they
      now believed to have been pure inventions of her enemies, the Despencers.
      No voice was raised against her though she came with her son, the Prince
      of Wales, attended by an outlawed traitor and a band of foreigners to
      raise a revolt against her own husband. It seems strange that such a
      wicked woman should have met with such success; but <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link206" id="link206">206</a></span>every Plantagenet in England was
      on her side, and she had many French relations there who always had
      thought her of more importance than the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of taking measures to defend himself, Edward wrote pathetic
      letters to the Pope and to the King of France asking for aid, and issued a
      proclamation offering £1,000 for the head of the arch traitor, Roger
      Mortimer. The queen then offered a reward of double that sum for the head
      of the younger Despencer, and declared that her only motive in coming home
      was to deliver England from the king's bad advisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Isabella attended church at Oxford in company with her son, Mortimer,
      and all her followers, the Bishop of Hereford preached the sermon and
      explained the queen's motive for taking up arms, concluding with this
      sentence: "When the head of a kingdom becometh sick and diseased, it must
      be taken off without useless attempts to administer any other remedy." It
      is shocking to think of the wife and son of a man so devoted to both, as
      King Edward certainly was, listening to such a murderous speech without
      expressing their horror and indignation. But the only effect of it was to
      increase the madness of the populace against the unhappy king, who,
      attended by the two Despencers and a few other friends, fled to Bristol,
      intending to seek refuge in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      His departure was the signal for a general uprising of the Londoners, who
      mobbed the Tower, and set all the prisoners free in the queen's name. Then
      Isabella pursued her husband with her army, which had largely increased,
      and laid siege to Bristol. The king shut himself up with the younger
      Despencer in the castle, much grieved to see how all his subjects had
      turned against him. The older Despencer was seized and brought before
      Isabella, who declared "that she should see that law and justice were
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link207" id="link207">207</a></span>executed
      on him according to his deeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, madam," he replied; "God grant me an upright judge and a just
      sentence! and that if I cannot find it in this world, I may find it in
      another."
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight was ninety years of age when he made this reply, but that was
      of no consequence to Isabella; she had him in her power at last, and was
      determined to punish him. He was sentenced, and his execution took place
      within sight of his son and the king, who were still shut up in the
      castle. So alarmed were they at the old man's tragic fate that they
      endeavored to escape to Wales in a little boat. After tossing about for
      some days they were driven back by contrary winds to within a mile of the
      castle they had fled from. A knight, observing the efforts of the boatmen,
      rowed out in his own barge with a strong force to see what was the matter,
      and soon succeeded in capturing the king and his favorite, both of whom
      were delivered over to the queen as her prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Isabella's evil nature blazed out and showed her real character. She
      started with all her army for London, having caused Sir Hugh Despencer to
      be bound to the smallest and meanest horse that could be found, and
      dressed in his mantle of state, on which was embroidered his coat-of-arms.
      Thus was he led in mockery through all the towns they passed, his approach
      being announced by trumpets and cymbals. When they reached Hereford the
      royal party were received with great rejoicing, and stopped there to
      celebrate the feast of All Saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate Hugh Despencer, who had eaten not a mouthful since the
      moment of his arrest, now became faint, and Isabella feared that he might
      succumb before reaching London. He was, therefore, brought to trial
      without further delay, and most cruelly put to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several other gentlemen who had in one way or another <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link208" id="link208">208</a></span>offended either the queen or her
      friend, Mortimer, were executed in the same place.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the army, which had been increased to an enormous size by volunteers
      by the way, arrived in London, great crowds flocked to welcome them,
      presenting costly gifts to Isabella and some of her followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th of January parliament met and decided to remove their absent
      sovereign, proclaiming the Prince of Wales King of England by the title of
      Edward III. When this was made known to the queen she pretended to be very
      much distressed, and actually forced herself to shed tears, though it was
      precisely what she had worked for. But she overacted her part, and her
      counterfeit tears so deceived her son that he made a solemn vow not to
      accept the crown unless his royal father should willingly resign it to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was awkward; for how could a committee wait upon the king to ask him
      to abdicate? But young Edward adhered to his resolution, and a dozen
      commissioners were appointed by Isabella to demand of the fallen monarch
      his crown, sceptre, and the rest of the regalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded to Kenilworth Castle, where Edward was kept as a state
      prisoner, and in a cruel, heartless manner pointed out to him the errors
      he had committed as their reason for desiring him to resign his crown.
      Edward listened to the mortifying recital and wept bitterly. At length he
      replied, "that he knew he was punished for his many sins, and was grieved
      for having incurred the hatred of his people. He was glad his eldest son
      was so gracious in their sight, and gave them thanks for choosing him to
      be their king." Although the poor monarch had fainted during this
      interview, he failed to arouse the sympathy of the commissioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward II. was by no means a bad man, for his chief <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link209" id="link209">209</a></span>faults were those of judgment,
      and at times want of dignity, which led him to engage in boyish frolics,
      and occasionally to drink to excess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1326.</span> On the following Christmas day, 1326,
      young King Edward, who was just fifteen years of age, was crowned in
      Westminster Abbey. Then twelve bishops and nobles were appointed to advise
      and assist the youthful sovereign in affairs of state. The queen offered
      no objection, but as she had the military power in her own hands she made
      Roger Mortimer her prime minister, and demanded an enormous sum of money
      for her own use. She sent presents and deceitful messages full of
      affection to her husband, who in return wrote to request the favor of
      being once more permitted to see her and his son. But Isabella was never
      softened towards him, though she was, to a great extent, the cause of his
      unfortunate situation. She was so thoroughly hard-hearted that, when she
      heard he was kindly treated at Kenilworth, she had him removed from one
      place to another under the care of two brutal fellows whose cruelties were
      too horrible to mention. One night, just a year after the queen's return,
      Edward II. was put to death by her order in Berkeley Castle, and buried
      privately. Then the nation became indignant; many of Isabella's friends
      deserted her when they found that they had been the tools of an artful,
      ambitious, depraved woman, and a strong party was organized to get rid of
      her. She had committed more crimes in one year than the late king and his
      ministers had done in twenty, though she pretended to be a reformer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a cruel hypocrite, planning, with the slyness of a cat, the
      destruction of each member of the royal family. Knowing that the Earl of
      Kent was most miserable on account of the part he had taken in her
      proceedings, she caused somebody to tell him that his brother was not
      dead, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link210" id="link210">210</a></span>but
      a prisoner at Corfe Castle. The earl employed a friar to inquire whether
      this was true.

    <p>
      He was assured that it was, and had shown to him at a distance a person
      seated at a table so disguised as to resemble the dead king. The earl then
      went to the castle and requested the governor to conduct him to his
      brother's apartment. The governor did <span class="pagenum"><a

      deny that edward was in the castle, but said that he was not permitted to
      let any one see him, upon which the earl wrote a letter to be conveyed to
      the supposed prisoner. this letter was immediately carried to the queen,
      who used it as a pretence for the earl's arrest, and after an absurd trial
      he was unjustly condemned to die. His estates passed into the hands of
      mortimer's son.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Roger Mortimer had made himself so offensive with his haughty
      display and his cruelty that the king had him arrested and locked up in
      the Tower. A few days later he was executed with several of his friends,
      and his body hung on the gallows at Tyburn for two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus rid himself of his worst enemy, Edward III. ordered his mother
      to live at Castle Rising, where, with plenty of people to wait on her, and
      everything to make her comfortable, she passed her time quietly, having no
      chance to scheme or plot against the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she remained for about twenty-seven years, receiving occasional
      visits from her son, who never permitted her name to be mentioned in his
      presence, excepting with great respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1358.</span> She died in 1358, and was buried by
      Edward III. with much ceremony at Grey Friars' Church, her body being
      attired in the uniform of that order of nuns.

    <p>
      A fine alabaster tomb was erected to her memory, the only inscription

      CHAPTER XIII. PHILIPPA OF HAINAULT, QUEEN OF EDWARD III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1311-1369).
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Edward, Prince
      of Wales, was, with his mother, compelled to seek refuge at the house of
      the Count of Hainault (of which we have given an account in the story of
      Isabella of France), he fell violently in love with the count's second
      daughter, Philippa, and she returned his affection. She was only fifteen
      years of age, and he a few months older, but they formed an attachment
      that lasted throughout their lives. Philippa was a brilliant Flemish
      beauty, whose excellent heart and lovable disposition endeared her to all
      who knew her. Later, as Queen of England, she proved a blessing to that
      country by the wisdom and good judgment she displayed in encouraging
      manufactures and trade. But before she assumed that position she was
      doomed to many months of anxiety and uncertainty; for her young lover,
      after only a fortnight's enjoyment of her society, departed on the
      dangerous expedition of invading his father's kingdom. There was
      considerable doubt as to whether he would ever return, because not only
      were the affairs of his country in such a condition that he could not
      foretell what turn they might take, but the relatives of both the lovers
      might interpose many objections to their union.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the custom in those days for the heir of England to acknowledge
      that he had made his choice of a wife without first consulting his
      parliament and councillors,

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link217" id="link217">217</a></span>but
      young Edward imparted his secret to his mother, and, as she had taken a
      great fancy to pretty Philippa, she promised to aid him as best she could.
      Therefore as soon as possible after her return home she led the public
      authorities to decide that one of the four daughters of the Count of
      Hainault would be the most desirable alliance for her son, but without
      naming which one. However, we may be very sure that the young man gave his
      own private instructions to his messengers, for they made no mistake in
      their choice, nor is it likely that he would risk trusting entirely to
      their discretion as to which of the young Hainault ladies would prove most
      worthy to become Queen of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The messengers applied first to Sir John, Philippa's uncle, who had been
      in England fighting the cause of the new king, and requested his
      assistance in the selection of a wife for their young sovereign. Sir John
      received them with all the honors he could lavish, and gave them the most
      sumptuous feasts and splendid entertainments of all sorts. After several
      days spent in this manner, he conducted them to Valenciennes, where they
      were equally well received at his brother's house. A special dispensation
      was required from the Pope, because the two mothers of the lovers were
      cousins; so messengers were sent to obtain it, which they did without much
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1327.</span> As soon as Edward heard that all
      necessary arrangements had been completed, he ordered the marriage
      ceremony to be performed at Valenciennes, though as he was engaged in a
      war on the Scottish border with the renowned Robert Bruce, he could not be
      present. In the absence of the bridegroom, the wedding must have been
      rather a tame affair, but there was no help for it, and preparations were
      made for a grand display. The costume and equipage of the bride were
      unusually costly and elegant, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link218"
      id="link218">218</a></span>no expense or pains being spared to render the
      festival worthy of the wealthy country in which it was given.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards Philippa, accompanied by her Uncle John and a large retinue,
      proceeded to Dover, and then to London, where a solemn procession of the
      clergy introduced her into the city, and she was presented by the lord
      mayor with a service of silver worth three hundred pounds as a marriage
      gift. The city was illuminated, and there were great rejoicings, feasts
      and public entertainments of all sorts, that were kept up for three weeks
      after the bride's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not stay long in London, however, but hurried on to York to meet
      her husband, being received with honors at every town through which she
      passed. All the parliament and royal council assembled at the union of the
      young king and his bride, as well as a hundred of the principal nobility
      of Scotland, who came to conclude a final peace with England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is said about the bride's marriage dowry, because the queen-mother
      had already got possession of it and spent it. She had besides so managed
      to get hold of the public funds that the young sovereign of England was
      nearly penniless. The following summer was passed by the new couple at
      Woodstock, the beautiful country residence which was the favorite home of
      Philippa so long as Isabella, the queen-mother, and Mortimer ruled the
      kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John of Hainault returned to his native land laden with jewels and
      rich presents, almost all of his countrymen accompanying him. Among the
      few who remained behind was a youth named Sir Walter Mauny, whose office
      was to carve for Philippa. He became one of the first Knights of the
      Garter, an order established by Edward III., of which we shall hear later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1330.</span> The coronation of the young queen did
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link219" id="link219">219</a></span>not
      take place for nearly two years after her marriage. All the customary
      duties were performed on that occasion, but the ceremony was remarkable
      for the absence of display on account of the emptiness of the treasury.

      The queen-mother, with her favorite, Mortimer, had used up all the public
      funds for their own support, but young Edward was not going to stand such
      a state of affairs much longer, and before the close of the year he had
      liberated himself from his wicked mother's control and executed her
      favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the reins of government in his own hands, the young king, aided by
      his good and sensible wife, set to work to reform the abuses of his
      mother's reign and to establish most excellent and satisfactory laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward had a very violent temper, which would have led him to commit many
      an act of cruelty and injustice had it not been for the influence of his
      kind-hearted, virtuous wife.

      <span class="side">A.D. 1330.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link220" id="link220">220</a></span>Her eldest son, Edward, surnamed
      the Black Prince on account of the color of the armor he wore in battle,
      was born while she was living at Woodstock, and in celebration of that
      event a grand tournament was arranged to take place in London. Philippa,
      with all the noble ladies, was invited to attend. The preparations were on
      a much grander scale than usual, thirteen knights being engaged on either
      side. The arena was covered with sand to prevent the horses' feet from
      slipping; flags and banners were ingeniously arranged as decorations, and
      a temporary platform was erected and ornamented for the accommodation of
      the queen and her ladies. No sooner were they all seated than the
      scaffolding gave way, and they tumbled pell-mell to the ground.
      Fortunately the platform was not high, and nobody was hurt, but the ladies
      were terribly frightened, and, for a few moments, the confusion and
      excitement were very great.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king flew into a perfect fury and vowed that the careless carpenters
      should instantly be put to death. This was rather a severe sentence,
      particularly as the damage was slight, and so Philippa considered it, for
      scarcely had she recovered from her fright than she threw herself on her
      knees before her angry husband, and pleaded with angelic sweetness for the
      pardon of the poor men. Edward soon became calm under the influence of her
      gentle voice and words, and forgave the offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time all the wool grown in England had been sent to the
      Netherlands to be manufactured into cloth, and Philippa remembered what a
      source of profit and occupation it had been for her own country. She
      therefore set to work to establish a manufacturing colony at Norwich, and
      a letter was sent to John Kemp of Flanders, cloth-weaver, in which he is
      informed, "that if he will come to England with the servants and
      apprentices of his mystery, and with <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link221" id="link221">221</a></span>his goods and chattels, and with
      any dyers who maybe willing to accompany him beyond the seas, and exercise
      their mysteries in the kingdom of England, they shall have letters of
      protection and assistance in their settlement."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1335.</span> He came, and was the patriarch of the
      Norwich woollen manufactories. Philippa often visited the colony, which
      soon brought considerable wealth into the country, encouraging the work by
      her patronage, and, like a beneficent queen of the hive cherishing and
      protecting the working bees, she made a law that no woollen clothes should
      be worn except those made in England. Besides the occupation which she
      thus provided for hundreds of her subjects, this young queen displayed
      unusual foresight for a woman of her age in the tournament exhibitions she
      held at Norwich, by which she gave the citizens assurance of gallant
      protection on the part of the nobility in case of need. These festivities
      brought together the workers and the defenders of the nation, and Queen
      Philippa set them the example of mutual respect. Edward III. did not often
      accompany his wife on her visits to Norwich, but usually passed the time
      of her absence with his unhappy mother at Castle Rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1333 Edward again commenced a furious war on Scotland. His faithful
      Philippa went with him as far as she could, and while he laid siege to
      Berwick took up her residence at Bamborough Castle. It was during this
      siege that the king committed a deed so atrocious that it must forever be
      a dark stain upon his character. Douglas, the defender of Scotland, left
      King Edward before Berwick and made a forced march to the castle that
      contained Queen Philippa, hoping to frighten the king and to force him to
      fly to her assistance. But he was mistaken, for Edward had too much
      confidence in the strength of the castle and the firmness of his wife to
      budge. It is probable though <span class="pagenum"><a name="link222"
      id="link222">222</a></span>that this attempt to capture Philippa
      aggravated his ferocious temper and prompted him to the cruel deed to
      which we have referred. The two young Seatons, sons of the Governor of
      Berwick, had been taken as prisoners, and the king had them put to death
      because the father refused to surrender the town. His object was to take
      Berwick by a desperate blow and fly to the relief of his queen, and he
      succeeded, for the poor grief-stricken father of the Seatons was so
      perfectly stunned by the infamous murder of his boys, that he could offer
      no further resistance. Douglas and Edward fought not far from Benwick,
      where the former was killed and the king entered the town in triumph with
      Philippa at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the queen's residence in the north of England quite an amusing
      circumstance occurred. King Edward had returned from Scotland, and his
      wife, who had been separated from him for a long time, went as far as
      Durham to welcome him back. He lodged at St. Cuthbert's Priory near the
      castle. After supper the queen entered her husband's apartments, where,
      feeling fatigued from her journey, she hoped to have a good night's rest.
      Scarcely had she undressed than there came a loud knocking at her door.
      Upon opening it several monks presented themselves with a pathetic appeal
      to her not to offend their holy patron St. Cuthbert, who during his life
      avoided the fair sex and would be dreadfully angry if one of them, no
      matter how high her rank, should sleep beneath the roof of his convent.
      The pious Philippa was distressed at the idea of having unintentionally
      displeased the saint, and fled in her night-clothes to the castle, which
      was fortunately not far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1336.</span> About this time Count William of
      Hainault died of gout, and Edward thus lost the liberal supplies that he
      had always counted on from that source. The English <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link223" id="link223">223</a></span>people of that period chose
      always to be at war; but expected their monarchs to pay the costs. Edward
      was reduced to such extreme poverty that he was forced to pledge his
      wife's crown for twenty-five hundred pounds, at the beginning of his long
      war, and during his whole reign the crown jewels were seldom out of pawn.
      He had been engaged in a naval battle with France since his victories in
      Scotland, and in 1340 found himself bankrupt. By that time Philippa had
      several children, and was residing in the Tower, where she devoted herself
      to their education with her usual good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we must see how Edward was led to establish the Order of the Garter.
      Wark Castle was under the guardianship of the Earl of Salisbury, who,
      while King Edward was encamped near Berwick, was taken prisoner. The
      Countess of Salisbury was then left alone at the castle with her young
      nephew, and it was besieged by the King of Scotland. Becoming alarmed at
      the approach of danger she sent the youth to seek assistance of Edward who
      immediately replied in person. At his appearance the siege was raised, and
      the countess, to prove her gratitude, ordered the gates to be thrown open,
      and received the king with great honors. She courtesied low, thanked her
      preserver warmly for his prompt aid, and conducted him into the castle,
      where he and all his knights and attendants were entertained sumptuously.
      Everybody was struck with the countess' noble deportment and affable
      behavior, and the king was charmed with her grace and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was dancing with her after the banquet she gave in his honor she
      unfortunately dropped her garter, and was overcome with confusion, but
      Edward with his usual gallantry picked it up and, holding it aloft, said:
      "<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "evil to him who evil thinks." In commemoration of this event, and out of
      compliment to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link224" id="link224">224</a></span>countess,
      he established an order called the Knights of the Garter. The queen
      attended the first meeting of this order at Windsor, on which occasion all
      the knights were accompanied by their ladies, who wore the badge with the
      motto the king had proposed as a bracelet on their left arm. The object of
      this order of knighthood was to assist distressed ladies, and after it was
      well established the king announced his intention of going to the aid of
      the Countess de Montfort, who was trying to uphold the cause of her infant
      son against the whole power of France, while her husband was a prisoner in
      the tower of the Louvre. He appointed Philippa regent, with the Earl of
      Kent as her assistant, and departed for France with his son Edward, then
      only sixteen years of age. At the battle of Cressy, which had occurred
      during the siege of Calais, this boy proved himself a true hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the king's absence, David of Scotland advanced into England and set
      fire to the suburbs of York. Philippa hastened in person to the relief of
      her northern subjects, and took up her residence at Newcastle. On the
      following day the King of Scots, with forty thousand men, halted within
      three miles of the town, and sent word to the queen that if her men were
      willing he would wait and give them battle. She replied: "that her barons
      would risk their lives for the realm of their lord, the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      When her army drew up in order of battle she rode among them mounted on
      her white charger, entreating the men "to fight manfully for the love of
      God." They promised to do the utmost in their power, and the queen
      withdrew after commending them "to the protection of God and St. George."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa had the moral courage becoming in a woman, and as soon as she had
      done all that a great queen could do for the encouragement of her army,
      she left the battlefield, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link225"
      id="link225">225</a></span>which was no place for her, and retired to pray
      for her invaded kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her army gained the victory, and King David was taken prisoner by a squire
      named John Copeland, who rode off with him and refused to give him up.
      This displeased Philippa, who the next day wrote to the squire commanding
      him to surrender the King of Scots to her forthwith. He replied, "that he
      would not give up his royal prisoner to a woman but only to his own lord,
      King Edward, for to him he had sworn allegiance and not to any woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen was troubled at this obstinacy, and wrote all about it to the
      king, who ordered John Copeland to come to him at Calais immediately. When
      Edward saw the squire he took him by the hand, saying: "Ha! welcome my
      squire, who by thy valor hast captured mine adversary, the King of Scots."
    </p>
    <p>
      John Copeland fell on one knee and replied: "If God out of his great
      goodness has given me the King of Scotland, and permitted me to conquer
      him in arms, no one ought to be jealous of it, for God can, if He please,
      send His grace to a poor squire as well as to a great lord. Sire, do not
      take it amiss if I did not surrender King David to the orders of my lady
      queen, for I hold my lands of <i>you</i> and not of <i>her</i>, and my
      oath is to you and not her, unless indeed through choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king thanked him warmly for his valor, and ordered him to go home and
      hand his prisoner, the King of Scotland, over to Philippa, adding, "and I
      assign lands as near your house as you can choose them to the amount of
      five hundred pounds a year for you and your heirs." The squire obeyed, and
      the excuses he made were so acceptable to the queen that she bore him no
      ill-will. She ordered King David to be conducted in grand procession
      through the streets mounted on a tall black war-horse, so that every one
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link226" id="link226">226</a></span>might
      know him and recognize him in case he attempted to escape, and then to be
      locked up in the Tower of London. Next day, accompanied by a large number
      of her ladies, she sailed for Calais, where Edward gave a magnificent <i>fête</i>
      to welcome his victorious queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the defenders of Calais were so much reduced by famine that they
      offered to surrender. At first Edward resolved to kill them every one, but
      in compliance with the request of Sir Walter Mauny, one of the Knights of
      the Garter, who begged him to be merciful, he softened somewhat, and sent
      this message: "Tell the Governor of Calais that the garrison and
      inhabitants shall be pardoned excepting six of the principal citizens, who
      must surrender themselves to death with ropes round their necks,
      bareheaded and barefooted, bringing the keys of the town and castle in
      their hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Walter carried the cruel verdict to the governor. He wept bitterly; he
      was compelled, however, to break the dreadful news to the inhabitants, who
      at the loud peals of the alarm-bell assembled in the town-hall. When they
      heard the king's message, they broke into loud lamentations of grief and
      despair. The hardest heart could not have failed to be touched by such a
      scene. Men stared at each other, scarcely knowing what to say or do. After
      a pause, Eustace St. Pierre, the most wealthy citizen of Calais, arose and
      offered himself as one of the six to make the horrible sacrifice for his
      fellow-townsmen. Five others followed this noble example amid the
      blessings and thanks of the assembly, and the number was completed.
      Mounted on a horse, the governor slowly and solemnly conducted them to the
      barriers, where Sir Walter Mauny awaited them, and said: "I deliver up to
      you, as Governor of Calais, these six citizens, and swear to you they are
      the most wealthy and respectable men of the town. I beg of you, gentle
      sir, that

    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot answer what the king will do with them," replied Sir Walter;
      "but you may depend upon this, that I will do all I can to save them."
    </p>
    <p>
      All the English nobles wept at the sight of these six gentlemen as they
      knelt before the king and begged for compassion, but Edward eyed them
      angrily and ordered their heads to be struck off forthwith. Some of the
      knights entreated the king to be more merciful, but he would not listen to
      them, and sternly repeated his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Philippa appeared. Falling on her knees at her husband's
      feet, she looked up into his face with tears in her eyes, and said: "Ah,
      gentle sir, since I crossed the sea with great peril to see you I have
      never asked you one favor; now I most humbly ask as a gift, for the sake
      of the son of the blessed Mary, and as a proof of your love to me, the
      lives of these six men."
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward looked at her for some time in silence, then replied: "Ah,
      lady, I wish you had been anywhere else than here; you have entreated in
      such a manner I cannot refuse you. I therefore give them to you&mdash;do
      as you please with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philippa then conducted the poor men to her own apartments, where their
      halters were removed from their necks and they were served with an
      excellent dinner. Afterwards she saw that they were conducted out of the
      camp in safety. The king entered Calais and took possession of the castle,
      where proper lodgings had been prepared for himself and his queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1348.</span> After their return to England, in
      1348, an awful epidemic, called the "black death," visited the kingdom and
      carried off the king and queen's second daughter, Johanna, a princess only
      fifteen years old, but blessed with <span class="pagenum"><a name="link230"
      id="link230">230</a></span>so many charms that a number of minstrels had
      chosen her for the subject of their verses. What made the event more than
      ordinarily sad was, that she was engaged to be married, and her funeral
      procession occurred at the very time that had been fixed for the wedding
      ceremony. This was a great sorrow to the royal couple. So dreadful was the
      pestilence that every household in London was afflicted by it, and in some
      families all the members died..
    </p>
    <p>
      Before this horrible visitation Philippa had turned her attention to the
      working of the coal mines in England, which, like the cloth manufacture,
      proved an industry of immense profit to the nation, besides enriching many
      private individuals. Wherever this great queen turned her patronage,
      prosperity was sure to follow, and her subjects loved and trusted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1357.</span> In 1357 the English gained a grand
      victory at Poictiers, and the Black Prince returned with many prisoners.
      Among them was one Bertrand Du Guesclin. One day when Queen Philippa was
      entertaining at her court a number of the noble French prisoners, the
      Prince of Wales proposed that Du Guesclin should name his own ransom,
      adding that whatever sum he mentioned should set him free. The warrior
      named a hundred thousand crowns. The Prince of Wales was astonished at
      such a sum, and asked how he could raise it. "I know a hundred knights,"
      replied Du Guesclin, "in my native Bretagne, who would mortgage their last
      acre rather than have me languish in captivity or be rated below my value.
      Yea, and there is not a woman in France now toiling with her distaff who
      would not devote a year's earnings to liberate me, for well have I
      deserved of their sex. And if all the fair spinners of France employ their
      hands to redeem me, think you, prince, that I shall abide much longer with
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Philippa, who had listened to this conversation

      great attention, now spoke: "I name," she said, "fifty thousand crowns, my
      son, as my contribution towards your gallant prisoner's ransom; for though
      an enemy to my husband, a knight who is famed for the courteous protection
      he has afforded to my sex deserves the assistance of every woman." Du
      Guesclin threw himself at the feet of the generous queen, saying: "Ah,
      lady, being the ugliest knight in France, I never reckoned on any goodness
      from your sex excepting those whom I protected with my sword, but your
      bounty will make me think less despicably of myself." Philippa, like all
      great women, honored those men who paid most reverence to her own sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a lingering illness, she sent for the king one day when she knew
      that death was approaching. Taking his hand in her own, she asked him to
      grant her three requests. He promised in advance with tears rolling down
      his cheeks. "My lord," she said, "I beg you will fulfil whatever
      engagements I have made with the merchants for their wares, as well on
      this as on the other side of the sea; I beseech you to fulfil whatever
      gifts or legacies I have made or left to churches and to all my servants,
      whether male or female; and when it shall please God to call upon you
      hence, you will choose no other sepulchre than mine, and that you will lie
      by my side in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey." The king replied:
      "Lady, all this shall be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1369.</span> Shortly after she died, and with her
      life departed the happiness, good fortune and even respectability of
      Edward III. and his family. Where Philippa had once promoted virtue,
      justice and wisdom, scenes of folly, strife and sorrow now followed at
      court. One of the chroniclers of the time says: "I firmly believe that her
      spirit was caught by holy angels and carried to the glory of Heaven, for
      she had never done anything by thought or deed to endanger her soul."

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he marriage of
      King Richard II. with Anne of Bohemia gave general satisfaction in
      England, and proved a happy one in every respect. At the coronation, which
      followed a few days after, the young bride received the title of "the good
      Queen Anne." It pained her to see the distress of the unhappy peasantry
      caused by the bloodshed and barbarous executions that had been the result
      of Wat Tyler's insurrection. She compared their miserable lot with her own
      bright and joyous one, and was thus prompted to ask a great favor of the
      king. Having first convinced herself that she would not be refused, she
      demanded a general pardon for all malefactors. Her mediation came in time
      to save the life of many an unfortunate creature, and sent a thrill of
      happiness through scores of afflicted households. No wonder then that she
      was called "good Queen Anne," but what was better still, she never
      forfeited the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Anne was not a beauty, but at the age of sixteen, when she became
      King Richard's wife, she was a blooming, healthy girl, with a clear, fresh
      complexion and bright eyes. She had a high, narrow forehead, long upper
      lip and fat cheeks, but the remarkable head-dress she wore neutralized
      these defects somewhat. It was a cap two feet high and equally wide,
      scooped out at the top so as to leave two high points resembling horns.
      This structure was made of wire and pasteboard, covered with a silky
      gauze. Though

      ugly and excessively uncomfortable, it was universally adopted by the
      English ladies in compliment to the queen, whose taste must have been
      somewhat defective if she was responsible for the device or crest she
      used, and required all her knights to wear at tournaments. It consisted of
      an ostrich, that most ungraceful of birds, with a bit of iron in his
      mouth. But Queen Anne introduced two articles into England that were no
      doubt gratefully received; one was the ordinary pin which we of the
      present day consider indispensable; the other was the side-saddle, not
      such as we are accustomed to, but a bench with a step suspended on which
      the rider's two feet were placed. This mode of riding may have been
      comfortable, but the horse had to be led by a groom because it was
      impossible for a lady to handle the reins herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1384.</span> At a festival of the Order of the
      Garter, in 1384, Queen Anne wore a robe of violet cloth lined with fur,
      with a hood of the same material faced with red. All her ladies were
      similarly attired. The king, who was quite a dandy, wore on that occasion,
      a coat embroidered in precious stones that cost thirty thousand marks. In
      this reign the shoes had long-pointed toes of an absurd length fastened to
      the knees with gold or silver chains, that must have been quite an
      annoyance to the wearer. But Richard II. was very luxurious in his tastes
      and so fond of spending money, that extravagant costumes were invented to
      please him, regardless of taste or convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Bohemia did not spend all her time in frivolous amusements, for
      she read the Scriptures in her native tongue, and may be considered one of
      the mothers of the Reformation. It is possible that she may have been
      influenced by her mother-in-law, Joanna, the Princess of Wales, whom she
      loved very much, but certain it is that when John Wickliffe was in danger
      of his life, at the council of <span class="pagenum"><a name="link238"
      id="link238">238</a></span>Lambeth, in 1382, both these royal ladies
      implored King Richard to aid in saving that reformer's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A war in Scotland called the king from home when he had been married a
      little over a year, and while he was away, his half-brother, John Holland,
      murdered Lord Stafford. The cause of this dreadful crime was jealousy.
      Stafford was a soldier of such high and noble character that he was a
      great favorite with the whole English army, and so chivalrous that the
      queen called him "her knight." It was when on his way with messages from
      the king to Anne that the encounter, which resulted in the death of the
      honored earl, took place. John Holland had noticed him, for many months,
      with increasing envy, which led him, at last, to slay one who had not
      given the slightest provocation for a quarrel. The father of Stafford was
      so distressed at the atrocious murder of his dearly-beloved son, that King
      Richard, prompted by the old man's demand for justice, vowed his brother's
      life should pay the forfeit of his deed. Meanwhile Holland had fled to the
      shrine of St. John of Beverly, and kept out of the way until the king
      returned from Scotland. Then Joanna, Princess of Wales, mother of Richard
      and John Holland, pleaded, with tears and lamentations, to one son for the
      life of another. Before it was granted, she died, and the king, unable to
      refuse her last request, pardoned the criminal, who started, at once, on
      an atoning pilgrimage to Syria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen was called upon to act as mediator again in 1387, after the
      defeat of the royal troops by the Duke of Gloucester and young Henry of
      Bolingbroke. The Archbishop of Canterbury was then sent to the king to
      propose a treaty of peace, but was absolutely refused admittance to his
      majesty's presence until the queen persuaded her husband to yield. After
      the interview the royal household removed from Bristol, where it had been
      established for several months, to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      and actually went on her knees to plead for the life of John Calverly, one
      of her esquires, but to no avail. That parliament was called "the
      merciless," and merited the title.

      The succeeding two years were passed by the royal couple at Shene, a
      favorite summer residence because of the beauty of the surrounding
      landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1389.</span> At the meeting of parliament in 1389
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link239" id="link239">239</a></span>the
      Duke of Gloucester, with his adherents, established a reign of terror that
      made fidelity to the king and queen an offence. Several members of Queen
      Anne's household were selected as victims, principally because they
      favored the cause of the Reformation and read the works of Wickliffe and
      Lollard. The queen spared no pains in trying to save her friends, ard
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link240" id="link240">240</a></span>asked
      them, "how old he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-two," was the reply, whereupon he declared that his ancestors had
      been considered of age much earlier, and it was therefore his intention to
      submit to control no longer. A sort of recoronation then took place at St.
      Stephen's Chapel, when the nobility renewed their oaths to the young
      sovereign, who thenceforth governed the kingdom himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A splendid tournament was held in honor of this event, over which Queen
      Anne presided. Sixty of her ladies, mounted on fine horses, each led by a
      knight, rode, to the sound of the trumpets, and attended by a train of
      minstrels, through the streets of London. When they arrived at the
      tilting-grounds at Smithfield, they passed before the queen, who was
      already seated on a richly decorated stand, then placed themselves on
      either side of her. The prizes consisted of a richly jewelled clasp and a
      gold crown, which the queen presented to the victors with her own hands.
      At the close of the match, a fine banquet was served, succeeded by
      dancing, which was kept up until a late hour in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1392.</span> In 1392 King Richard applied to the
      citizens of London for a loan of a thousand pounds. It was refused, but a
      wealthy Italian came forward and offered the whole of the sum, whereupon a
      mob set upon the unfortunate money-lender and tore him to pieces. Such a
      formidable riot was the result of this outrage that Richard took away the
      city charter and removed the law courts to York. This was a dilemma that
      had not been counted on, and occasioned so much distress and disturbance
      that Queen Anne was again called upon to act as mediator. This time she
      merely persuaded her husband to make a public
    </p>
    <p>
      passage through London with her, trusting to the citizens to do their
      part, which she would follow up with her request at the proper moment.
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link241" id="link241">241</a></span>The
      king, with his escort, appeared first in the procession, then followed the
      queen and her ladies. She wore her crown, a robe of rich velvet, and a
      large collar of precious stones that blazed in the sunlight as she moved
      along. The procession halted at Southwark bridge, where it was welcomed by
      the lord-mayor and other authorities, followed by representatives of every
      branch of trade carrying various devices. There the king was presented
      with a pair of snow-white horses, covered with trappings of gold cloth to
      which silver bells were attached. The queen received a beautiful white
      palfrey, and after listening to a long speech by the lord mayor, the
      procession moved on. All the streets through which they passed were hung
      with flags, banners and rich tapestry, the public fountains flowed with
      wine. At different points bands of music and singers were stationed, the
      latter strewing the path with fresh flowers as the royal couple
      approached. Some rare and valuable gifts were presented, among which was a
      tablet set in jewels with the crucifixion engraved thereon. The king took
      it in his hand and said: "Peace be to this city!" Another was handed to
      the queen bearing a request that she would not fail to plead for the
      king's pardon. She cast her eyes over it and said, with a confident air,
      "leave all to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at Westminster Palace, the king entered first, and proceeding
      to the great hall, mounted the throne, sceptre in hand, and awaited the
      arrival of the queen and the rest of the procession. After all had
      assembled, her majesty knelt at the feet of her royal spouse and in a
      firm, clear voice made an humble and loving appeal that the charters and
      liberties of his penitent subjects might be restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be satisfied, dearest wife," answered Richard, taking her hand and
      raising her from her lowly position, "loth should we be to deny thee any
      reasonable request. Meantime ascend, and sit beside me on my throne, while
      I speak a few words to my people." <span class="pagenum"><a name="link242"
      id="link242">242</a></span>His majesty then addressed the lord-mayor,
      thanked him for the exhibition of loyalty that had been made that day, as
      well as for the costly presents made to himself and his wife, bade him
      keep the peace of the city, and handed him back the key and sword of his
      office. This reconciliation cost the city ten times as much as the loan
      their sovereign had required. King Richard was preparing for a campaign in
      Ireland in the June of 1394 when his beloved wife was taken from him. She
      died at Shene, and in the bitterness of his grief, unable to bear the
      sight of the palace in which he had spent so many happy hours with his
      late companion, Richard had it destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of Anne of Bohemia was carried in grand procession to London and
      buried at Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard went to Ireland shortly after, and frequently in the
      council-chamber of Dublin when anything recalled his "good Queen Anne" to
      his thoughts he suddenly would burst into tears and leave the room.

      CHAPTER XV. ISABELLA OF VALOIS, SURNAMED THE LITTLE QUEEN, SECOND WIFE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      OF RICHARD II.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      (A. D. 1387-1410.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t seems strange
      that when Richard II. reached the age of thirty he should have had a fancy
      to share his throne with a child of nine, yet that was the age of Isabella
      of Valois, when he married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the eldest daughter of Charles VI. of France and the wicked
      Isabeau of Bavaria; but fortunately she inherited nothing from her mother
      but her beautiful dark eyes and clear olive complexion; her goodness and
      lovely character she got from her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Richard was told that Isabella was too young for him, he replied:
      "that every day would remedy the deficiency of age, and her youth was one
      of his reasons for preferring her, because he should educate her to his
      own mind, to the manners and customs of the English; and that, as for
      himself, he was young enough to wait for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1396.</span> When the English ambassadors waited
      on Isabella to solicit her hand for Richard, one of them dropped upon his
      knees and said: "Madam, if it please God, you shall be our lady and
      queen." Without any prompting, the little maid replied; "Sir, if it please
      God and my lord and father that I be Queen of England, I shall be pleased
      thereat, for I have been told I shall then be a great lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her appearance and manners were very pleasing, and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link244" id="link244">244</a></span>from the time when it was
      proposed that she should marry Richard, she began to practise how to
      behave as queen, though she could not prepare herself for the sad
      experience that awaited her in that exalted position.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard went to Paris, attended by a retinue of the first noblemen of
      his realm, to claim his little wife. At a magnificent dinner given by the
      King of France, the last of a series of entertainments that had been held
      in honor of his royal guest, Isabella was presented to her future lord.
      Then, attended by her parents and the whole court, she was conveyed in a
      rich litter to Calais, where the marriage ceremony was performed by the
      Archbishop of Canterbury. "The little queen," as Isabella was called from
      that time, made a public entry into London a few days later, when many
      rich and beautiful gifts were presented to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride's marriage portion consisted of 800,000 francs in gold. Her
      trousseau was magnificent; among the garments was a robe and mantle such
      as had never been seen in England for costliness. It was composed of
      crimson velvet, embossed with solid gold birds, perched on branches of
      real pearls and emeralds. Down each side was a border of miniver, there
      was a cape and hood of the same fur, and the mantle was lined throughout
      with ermine. Another robe was light blue velvet, embroidered with pearl
      roses; the little lady had besides coronets, rings, necklaces, and buckles
      worth a large sum of money and beautiful enough to delight the heart of
      any girl. Her bedroom curtains were of red and white satin with
      embroidered figures. Isabella was crowned at Westminster in 1397, when she
      was just ten years old; then she went to reside at Windsor, where her
      education was continued under the guidance of Lady de Courcy.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Richard made frequent visits to his little wife, each

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link247" id="link247">247</a></span>one
      being the occasion of a holiday from study, and of a great deal of
      pleasure to the child who anticipated the appearance of her lord with no
      little impatience. Richard was always courteous and gentle in his manners
      towards ladies, and had a lively disposition, which rendered him a very
      congenial companion; besides, he dressed with such exquisite taste that
      the admiration he inspired in the heart of Isabella warmed into an
      affection that she never ceased to entertain for him as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      When King Richard went to France to claim his bride, he spent so much
      money that he found himself deeply involved in debt. This led to a fierce
      struggle with the party headed by his uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, and
      the Earl of Arundel. At last Richard would bear it no longer, so he
      managed to rid himself of both his opponents. This he did by having the
      duke treacherously murdered, and the earl illegally executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Richard was not accustomed to such cruel deeds, and his conscience
      troubled him to such a degree that he would often start up from his bed at
      night and cry out in horror: "That his bed was covered with the blood of
      the earl." The sudden death of Roger Mortimer, lord deputy of Ireland, to
      whom Richard was warmly attached, called him to that country to quell the
      rebellion that ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his departure he went to Windsor to bid farewell to Isabella; while
      there he dismissed Lady de Courcy on account of excessive extravagance,
      and appointed his widowed niece, Lady Mortimer, in her stead, as governess
      and first lady of honor to his young consort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting scene between the royal couple was very touching, the king
      lifting his wife up in his arms and kissing her repeatedly while offering
      words of hope and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry of Bolingbroke, who had been absent from England <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link248" id="link248">248</a></span>for several
      years, returned while Richard was away,&mdash;a most unfortunate
      circumstance for the royal cause. The Duke of York, who acted as regent in
      the king's absence, was alive to the little queen's position, and hurried
      her off to the fortress of Wallingford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attended by sixty thousand fighting men, Henry of Bolingbroke marched
      through England and presented himself before the very gates of Flint
      Castle, where Richard, with a handful of faithful knights, had fortified
      himself. Upon Henry's boldly demanding admittance the king agreed to allow
      him, with eleven others, to pass the wicket of the castle. But it was soon
      evident that any such precaution was unnecessary, for on looking out of
      the window the king beheld the army that had come to besiege him, and
      surrendered himself at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      While King Richard and Henry of Bolingbroke stood in the courtyard of the
      castle waiting for their horses, Math, the beautiful greyhound that always
      accompanied the king when he rode out, and would never follow nor notice
      anyone else, suddenly dashed through the court, leaped upon Henry, and put
      both paws on his shoulders, as he had been wont to do to the king. Henry
      asked the meaning of his being thus selected for the animal's caresses.
      "Cousin," replied the king sadly, "it means a great deal for you, and very
      little for me; for the natural instinct of my favorite dog prompts him to
      fondle and pay his court to you as King of England, which you will be, and
      I shall be deposed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard was taken to London and lodged in the Tower, where he suffered
      torment because he could get no information as to the fate of his
      Isabella. After a time he offered to resign his crown to Henry of
      Bolingbroke, now called the Duke of Lancaster, but received only taunts
      and reproaches in reply. Meanwhile "the little queen" had been removed
      from Wallingford to Leeds Castle in Kent. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link249" id="link249">249</a></span>At the next session of
      parliament, the members remained seated at Westminster Hall, while Henry,
      with a number of priests, dukes, and earls rode to the Tower, dismounted
      in the courtyard and entered the Hall. Then King Richard, on being
      summoned, walked in with his crown upon his head and the sceptre in his
      hand, and addressed the assembly as follows: "I have reigned King of
      England, Duke of Aquitaine, and Lord of Ireland about twenty-two years;
      which royalty, lordship, sceptre, and crown, I now freely and willingly
      resign to my cousin, Henry of Lancaster, and entreat of him in the
      presence of you all to accept this sceptre." The king was then conducted
      back to his apartments in the Tower, and the crown and sceptre were safely
      locked away in the treasury of Westminister Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following October, Henry of Lancaster assembled parliament, and was
      crowned with great ceremony as Henry IV. Isabella had been removed to
      Sunning Hill, where she was treated as a state prisoner, and kept in
      ignorance of the fate of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after the coronation of Henry IV. a plot against his life was
      discovered, and then the fate of poor Richard was sealed, as we shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's attendants kept constantly reminding him, by hints and
      insinuations, that as long as Richard lived he could not reign peaceably,
      until worn out with care and anxiety he wearily asked one day while
      sitting at table: "Have I no faithful friend who will deliver me of one
      whose life will be my death, and whose death my life?" After such a speech
      from the king it was not likely that Richard's life would long be spared.
      His attendants began to treat him with so little ceremony at last that the
      royal prisoner remarked upon it one day when he was dining; whereupon he
      was informed that King Henry had given new orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee together!" <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link250" id="link250">250</a></span>exclaimed
      Richard in a passion, striking the attendant who had answered with a
      carving-knife. At that instant eight armed men rushed into the room;
      Richard started up, seized the weapon that the one nearest to him, held,
      and defended himself so valiantly that four of the attacking party were
      slain outright. Then while he was fiercely warding off the blows of three
      others, the leader of the band jumped upon the chair Richard had occupied
      while dining, and dealt him a blow on the back of his head that killed him
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1339.</span> Thus fell the son of the Black Prince
      at the early age of thirty-two, and Queen Isabella was made a widow before
      she was thirteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of France was suffering from an attack of insanity, therefore
      could take no steps for the restoration of his daughter, but the French
      council requested Henry IV. to allow her to return to her native land. He
      refused, saying "that she should reside in England, as all other
      queen-dowagers had done, in great honor; and that if she had unluckily
      lost a husband she should be provided with another who would be young,
      handsome, and in every way deserving of her love, that person being no
      other than the Prince of Wales." But Isabella mourned her murdered spouse
      so sincerely that she rejected the gallant Henry of Monmouth and no longer
      felt any pride in being Queen of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charles VI. recovered, he sent ambassadors to inquire into the
      condition of his daughter in England, and to make arrangements for her
      return. But it was not until late in July, eighteen months after the death
      of Richard II. that his widow was restored to her parents. Henry had
      seized her jewels and dower, and refused to give them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1402.</span> The goodness and amiable disposition
      of the youthful queen had won the affection of her English ladies, and
      when she parted from them they wept so much
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link253" id="link253">253</a></span>that
      she was obliged to comfort them, though she, too, was in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1406 Henry IV. again proposed for the hand of Isabella for the Prince
      of Wales, declaring that if the marriage could be brought about he would
      abdicate the English crown in favor of his son. But the little queen had
      meanwhile promised to marry her cousin, Charles of Angoulême, sun of the
      Duke of Orleans. An unfavorable answer was therefore given to the English
      ambassadors, who were very much displeased at their failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabella was not married to her cousin until the murder of his father by
      the Duke of Burgundy made him Duke of Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1410.</span> She loved him dearly, and lived
      happily with him for nearly two years, but she was only a little more than
      twenty-one when her death occurred. This Duke of Orleans was a celebrated
      poet, whose compositions are still read in France. We quote one written
      shortly after his sad bereavement, but it is much prettier in the original
      French:&mdash;

      CHAPTER XVI. JOANNA OF NAVARRE, QUEEN OF HENRY IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1370-1437.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was to the Duke
      of Bretagne, Joanna of Navarre's first husband, that Henry IV. was partly
      indebted for his elevation to the throne of England. Henry was an exile
      when Richard II. was obliged to go to Ireland, and finding that a clear
      field was thus left for his return, he applied to the Duke of Bretagne for
      advice and assistance, and was unhesitatingly provided by him with
      vessels, soldiers, and arms. The use he made of them is recounted in the
      last reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna, the duke's wife, met Henry of Bolingbroke, the first time when he
      was making his preparations for this expedition to England, and was very
      much pleased with his beauty and attractive manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1401.</span> When she had been a widow for two
      years, and Henry was established on the throne, she willingly accepted an
      offer of his hand in marriage. He had then been a widower since 1394, when
      Anne of Bohemia, his first wife, died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna of Navarre agreed to marry Henry IV., but she had a family of
      children, and before going to England she had to provide for them. She
      knew that it would be unwise to take her sons with her, and as the eldest
      had succeeded to his father's title, the people of Bretagne would
      naturally object to his making England his home, so she entered into a
      treaty with her uncle, the Duke of Burgundy,

      faithfully swore to preserve the laws, liberties and privileges of the
      Bretons. Thereupon the little duke and his two brothers, Arthur and Jules,
      were placed under his care, and taken to Paris to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1402.</span> The two daughters accompanied their
      mother to Winchester, where King Henry awaited her. The marriage was
      publicly solemnized at the church, of St Swithin, and afterwards there was
      a splendid feast. The citizens of London made costly preparations to
      receive the bride, whose coronation took place Feb. 26, 1403, nearly three
      weeks after her landing in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was thirty-three years old at that time, but she was still
      handsome, majestic, and graceful; she was, besides, a woman of excellent
      common sense, but excessively avaricious. Indeed, this besetting sin not
      only prompted her to make unjust demands on her subjects, and to accept
      unlawful bribes, but also prevented her from performing those deeds of
      charity that one reasonably expects from people in lofty positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The festivities that succeeded the coronation were rudely interrupted by
      an attack of the Bretons on the merchant shipping along the coast of
      Cornwall. This made the queen distasteful to her new subjects at once,
      though as her own son, the Duke of Bretagne, was then entirely under the
      influence of the Duke of Burgundy, it was the French who were responsible
      for the attack. Then followed the Percy rebellion and the battle of
      Shrewsbury, where the king so nearly lost his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1404</span> Joanna further increased her
      unpopularity by filling her palace with her former subjects, an error that
      many Queens of England had made before her. But in this instance it was
      soon rectified, for the House of Commons took the matter in hand and
      cleared the royal household of nearly all the Breton servants. As the king
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link258" id="link258">258</a></span>was
      well aware that the voice of the people had secured for him his position,
      he dared not interfere.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Three years after she had ascended the throne of England, Joanna was
      called upon to part with her daughters, because their brother, whose
      subjects they were, claimed them.

      a husband provided for each, and they were married soon after their return
      to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1413.</span> The death of Henry IV., which
      occurred in 1413, left Joanna again a widow. His interview with the Prince
      of Wales, during which he resigns his crown and offers most excellent
      advice, is correctly given in the fifth act of Shakespeare's Henry IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the new king, Henry V., ascended the throne, he treated his
      stepmother with every mark of attention and respect, so much so that when
      he started on his expedition against France she was appointed regent in
      his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1415.</span> The Duke of Bretagne took no part in
      this contest; but Queen Joanna's second son, Arthur, made the first attack
      on Henry's camp, at the head of two thousand French cavalry, near
      Agincourt. It was midnight on the eve of St. Crispin's day and a violent
      storm was raging when the assault was made. It resulted in victory for the
      English; Arthur was wounded and taken prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with an aching heart that Queen Joanna was called upon to receive
      the royal victor when all England rejoiced at his return; for her
      son-in-law and her brother had both been killed at the battle of
      Agincourt, and her son, Arthur, was brought to her kingdom in chains. She
      had been separated from the boy for twelve years, and now she was only
      permitted to give him a fond embrace, and then see him consigned to the
      gloomy Tower. Although Henry continued for a time to treat the queen with
      consideration, he would listen to no proposition or entreaty of hers for
      Arthur's release.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1419.</span> At last, on an accusation of
      witchcraft, preferred against Joanna by her confessor, who declared that
      she was planning with two sorcerers who were dealing with the powers of
      darkness for the destruction of the king, she <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link262" id="link262">262</a></span>was committed to Pevensey Castle
      as a prisoner. Henry V. gave the queen no opportunity of justifying
      herself, but no attempt of hers on his life was ever proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1422</span> Her money was all appropriated by King
      Henry, and she did not regain her liberty until his death was at hand;
      then his conscience smote him, and he did his utmost to make amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna lived many years to enjoy her restored liberty and kept her court
      chiefly at Havering Bower, surrounded by all the luxuries that wealth
      could procure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She died in 1437, and was buried at Canterbury Cathedral beside Henry IV.

      CHAPTER XVII. KATHERINE OF VALOIS, SURNAMED THE FAIR, WIFE OF HENRY V.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1401-1437.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>harles VI., King
      of France, and his wife, Queen Isabeau of Bavaria, had eight children,
      three sons and five daughters, of whom Katherine was the youngest. The
      boys became in turn Dauphins of France; Isabella, the eldest of the
      family, was married to Richard II. when she was only eight years of age,
      and had an experience throughout her short life such as has never been
      recorded of so young a girl. But she proved herself a devoted wife, and
      bore her sufferings with true heroism. She died when Katherine was only
      nine years old. Two of the daughters of Charles VI. became duchesses,
      Marie entered a convent, and the two little ones, Michelle and Katherine,
      at the respective ages of three and five, we find shut up in the dismal
      Hôtel de St. Paul with their brothers and their infirm father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Isabeau was one of the most wicked women that ever lived, for she
      not only joined her brother-in-law, the Duke of Orleans, in stealing the
      revenues of the royal household, thus leaving her husband and children
      with no means of support, but she neglected them most criminally, and
      then, for a long time, deserted them. The poor king was insane, which fact
      in itself would have kept any true wife at his side, but his guilty,
      wretched consort deserved neither the title of wife nor mother, for she
      neglected her duty as both. Her daughters inherited her splendid, large,
      dark eyes, as veil as her clear, brilliant complexion, but, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link264" id="link264">264</a></span>fortunately
      for themselves and others, none of her wickedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at the Hôtel de St. Paul these poor little children were almost
      starved to death, and as their mother had left them without a change of
      linen they ran about in filthy rags. Some of the inferior attendants of
      the palace had compassion enough to give them a little food, but the
      servants of the royal family were left without money, consequently they
      neither could nor would provide for the children. Their condition must
      have been pitiable, indeed, but God watched over them, and as by a miracle
      their father's reason suddenly returned to him one day. For a long while
      he had been totally unconscious of the misery that surrounded him. What
      must have been the agony of the good man when he beheld his own plight and
      that of his innocent, forsaken little ones? It makes one shudder at the
      thought. But it had a different effect on the cruel, infamous Isabeau; for
      no sooner did she hear that her husband's reason was restored than she
      began to tremble for her own safety, as well she might. She therefore
      hurried away to Milan, and ordered her brother Louis, who was as bad as
      she, to bring the children to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, and not only carried off the five royal children but also those
      of the Duke of Burgundy. Their absence was soon discovered, and the duke
      sent a troop of armed men after them, who overtook them before they had
      got very far. After securing the children of both families the men turned
      respectfully to the Dauphin Louis, then only ten years old, and asked him
      "whither he would please to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will return to my royal father," replied the boy. He was eagerly obeyed
      and carried back to Paris with his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, Isabeau got possession of the little Katherine, but her conduct
      became so infamous that she was imprisoned,<span class="pagenum"><a

      excellent education. At the age of ten he played the harp well, and was
      extremely fond of music. Later in life he performed on the organ and
      composed sacred airs. After his mother's death, Richard II. took
      possession of the boy, who then lived at the palace, until he was placed
      at Oxford to complete his studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only sixteen years old when he fought at the bar <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link267" id="link267">267</a></span>and the child
      was sent to a convent to be educated. We will leave her there for a while

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1387.</span> He was born in 1387, and was a very
      sickly infant, but he had a devoted mother, who took such good care of him
      that he soon grew strong. She gave him his first lessons in Latin, and he
      was afterwards blessed with an title <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link268" id="link268">268</a></span>of Shrewsbury, where he proved
      himself a brave prince. He advanced too rashly on the enemy, and received
      a serious wound in the face that left a scar to the end of his life. On
      being advised to retire that the point of the arrow might be taken out,
      "To what place?" he asked, "who will remain fighting, if I, the prince, a
      king's son, retire for fear at the first taste of steel? let my
      fellow-soldiers see that I bleed at the first onset; for deeds, not words,
      are the duties of princes who should set the example of boldness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry V. was extremely poor while he was Prince of Wales; but that did not
      prevent his enjoying himself, even though his dissipations, and
      recklessness forced him into company far beneath him in rank. He was at
      times so pushed for money that he would disguise himself as a highwayman,
      and lie in wait for the collectors of the rents due the crown and rob
      them. Sometimes he got soundly beaten himself, but he always rewarded
      those officers who made the boldest fight. He knew how to appreciate
      faithfulness, even when it told against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He performed some of the wildest pranks when he lived at a manor near
      Coventry. On one occasion he and some of his friends were arrested by the
      mayor of that town for raising a riot, and this was not the only time that
      he was locked up in jail. The young nobles found that they could have so
      much liberty and fun at "Prince Hal's" house that they preferred it to the
      king's court. This made Henry IV. quite jealous at times, but it did not
      prevent their flocking to the manor and enjoying their mad frolics. During
      one of these, a favorite servant of the prince was arrested and taken
      before Judge Gascoigne. No sooner did Henry hear of it than he rushed to
      the court of justice, where the servant stood awaiting his trial. Walking
      boldly up to the man he endeavored to remove his chains; the judge
      interfered, whereupon the prince boxed his ears <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link269" id="link269">269</a></span>soundly. Such an outrage caused
      great indignation on the part of Gascoigne; who not only reproved the
      young man as he deserved, but actually had him locked up in the prison of
      the King's Bench. No doubt the prince regretted that he had allowed his
      temper to get the better of his common sense; for, after he had taken time
      to reflect, he submitted with a good grace to his well-merited punishment.
      When Henry IV. heard of this occurrence, he said: "he was proud of having
      a son who would thus submit himself to the laws, and that he had a judge
      who could so fearlessly enforce them."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time the king had been trying to get a wife for his wild son,
      no doubt with the hope that marriage would improve his bad behavior.
      Several ladies had been proposed, but in each case something happened to
      prevent an engagement. At last both father and son seemed determined on
      obtaining the fair Katherine for the lofty station of Princess of Wales.
      The Duke of York was sent on a private mission to demand her hand in
      marriage for Prince Henry, and while he was absent the king died.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short but fierce civil war had to be fought before Henry V. could take
      possession of the throne, because somebody raised a report that Richard
      II., who would have succeeded, was still alive. In order to restore peace,
      Henry was obliged to have Richard's corpse paraded through the streets. It
      was carried in a chair of state adorned with regal ornaments, Henry
      walking by its side, and all the court following. After a solemn ceremony
      it was safely laid away in Westminster Abbey, and tranquillity returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the new king made another application for the hand of Princess
      Katherine, at the same time demanding the enormous dowry of two millions
      of crowns and all the southern provinces of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles VI. tried to compromise,&mdash;and offered 450,000 <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link270" id="link270">270</a></span>crowns. This
      the English lover refused with disdain. In fact, he wanted an excuse for
      invading France, so resolved to fight for Katherine the Fair, and to win
      her, as well as the gold and the provinces he had demanded, at the point
      of the sword. In order to raise money for this expedition he had to sell
      or pawn all the valuables he owned, but his ambition was aroused and he
      never doubted that "the game was worth the candle."
    </p>
    <p>
      From Southampton Henry V. sent a letter to the King of France warning him
      of his intended invasion, and adding that if the southern provinces and
      the hand of Katherine were not bestowed on him at once he would take them
      by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king replied: "If that was his mind he would do his best to receive
      him; but as to the marriage he thought it would be a strange way of wooing
      Katherine, covered with the blood of her countrymen." This answer might
      have had a favorable effect on the young king had not the Dauphin Louis
      excited his anger by sending him a cask of tennis balls, saying, "that
      they were fitter playthings for him, according to his former course of
      life, than the provinces he demanded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These balls," replied Henry, making an angry pun, "shall be struck back
      with such a racket as shall force open the Paris gates."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1415.</span> He left Southampton in August, 1415,
      and after a furious battle took possession of Harfleur in October. In the
      winter he finished his campaign by the victory of Agincourt, which shed
      everlasting glory on his name. But it was a sad day for the enemy. France
      was thrown into a dreadful panic by the number of her nobles and princes
      that were slain at that battle. The Dauphin Louis is said to have died of
      grief on account of it; but when, shortly after, his death was followed by
      that of his brother, there was a report that the unnatural Isabeau had
      poisoned both her sons. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link271"
      id="link271">271</a></span>The malady of poor King Charles returned with
      so many misfortunes, and his wicked wife, taking advantage of the
      confusion in the country, made her escape from prison. She then joined the
      Duke of Burgundy, took the reins of government in her own hands, and
      obtained control of her beautiful daughter Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, although this woman had so shamefully neglected her
      children when they most required her care, she became quite proud of
      Katherine when she saw her such a lovely young woman, and soon exercised a
      surprising influence over her. The young princess had set her heart on
      becoming Queen of England, and in this her mother heartily seconded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry V. was laying siege to Rouen Isabeau sent him a picture of
      Katherine by an ambassador, who was to ask him, "whether so beautiful a
      princess required such a great dowry as he demanded with her?" The king
      gazed long and earnestly on the portrait, and acknowledged that it was
      suprisingly fair, but refused to diminish his demands in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1418.</span> At last the city of Rouen fell.
      France was in a state of despair, and the queen resolved to try what
      effect Katherine herself would have on the proud heart of the conqueror,
      since her picture had failed to satisfy him. A truce was therefore
      obtained and a conference appointed at a town called Pontoise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor crazy king, with the queen and Katherine, came to the place of
      meeting in a richly ornamented barge. There was a large enclosure made
      with planks on the banks of the river Seine; outside were tents and
      pavilions covered with blue and green velvet worked with gold. Some of
      these were occupied by the King and Queen of France, the Princess, the
      Duke of Burgundy, his council and a thousand soldiers. Then the King of
      England <span class="pagenum"><a name="link272" id="link272">272</a></span>arrived
      with his two brothers and his escort of men-at-arms, and took possession
      of the remaining tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conference was about to commence the queen entered the enclosure
      from the right side followed by Katherine. The King of England entered
      from the left, advanced towards the queen, whom he saluted with profound
      respect, and kissed her as well as the princess. He then took his seat
      opposite, while the Earl of Warwick made a long speech in French. Some
      time was spent in discussion, when the parties took leave of each other
      and separated, leaving everything as unsettled as before. Three weeks
      later the same personages, with the exception of Katherine, met for
      another conference on the same spot. Finding that her daughter's beauty
      had not induced the conqueror to lower his demands, Queen Isabeau would
      not permit Katherine to be present the second time. This arrangement
      displeased Henry very much, for he was desperately in love with the
      handsome dark-eyed princess. Still he remained firm, and the second
      conference ended as unsatisfactorily as the first had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoping that the family of his beloved would send some flattering messages,
      Henry waited a few days; but losing patience at last he demanded a third
      interview. He had now made up his mind that he would be satisfied with
      something less than he had at first required, and felt certain that he
      would only have to open his arms to receive his pretty lady-love. But lo,
      to his great surprise and disappointment, on arriving at Pontoise he found
      the tents removed, the fence that marked the enclosure torn down, and all
      the planks taken away, showing plainly that the marriage treaty was
      supposed to be at an end. It served him right, but he looked upon himself
      as the injured party, and flew into a perfect rage. He now loved Katherine
      more than before, and turning to the Duke of Burgundy, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link273" id="link273">273</a></span>the only
      member of the royal family of France who was present, he said; "Fair
      cousin, we wish you to know that we <i>will</i> have the daughter of your
      king, or we will drive him and you out of his kingdom." The duke replied
      angrily, and many high words passed between the two men before they
      separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry continued his war in France, conquering at every step, until,
      reduced to dire distress, the royal family were forced to pocket their
      pride, and beg to have the marriage treaty renewed. Henry was even asked
      to name his own terms. He haughtily replied: "That he had been deceived so
      often that he would treat with no one but the Princess Katherine herself,
      who, he was sure, would not try to deceive him." This message was carried
      to the queen, who returned a love-letter written by the princess, and a
      request that Henry would come to Troyes for the ceremony of espousal. He
      consented with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry V. had not been modest in his demands, for with the hand of
      Katherine he was to receive not only the provinces he had named in the
      first instance, but also the regency of the whole of France, thus
      disinheriting the older children of the royal family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1420.</span> On his arrival he was conducted with
      great ceremony to the Hôtel de Ville, where apartments had been provided
      for him, and the next day he met Queen Isabeau and his lady-love at the
      church of Notre Dame, where, before the high altar, the articles of peace
      were read and signed. Henry's tall, handsome figure was well set off that
      day by the magnificent suit of burnished armor in which he appeared. In
      his helmet was a fox's tail ornamented with precious stones. A flowing
      plume would have been much prettier, but he liked to dress oddly
      sometimes, and no doubt thought that a little surprise of this sort would
      excite Katherine's interest. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link274"
      id="link274">274</a></span>After the treaty was signed, King Henry
      requested an interview with his lady-love, which was granted, nobody
      besides being present excepting one female attendant. Katherine could
      speak little English, and Henry's knowledge of French was slight, which
      made their love scene, as Shakspeare has represented it, quite laughable.
      When he asks her: "Do you like me, Kate?" she replies: "Pardonnez moi, I
      cannot tell vat is&mdash;'<i>like me?</i>'" But when he tells her she is
      like an angel, her knowledge of English serves her very well, though she
      modestly refers to her attendant, who speaks worse than she does, to have
      it explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry makes a long speech, assuring her of his love, and asking for hers
      in return, and this she understands so well as to say: "Is it possible dat
      I sould love de enemy of France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he replies, "it is not possible you should love the enemy of France,
      Kate; but in loving me you should love the friend of France; for I love
      France so well that I will not part with a village of it: I will have it
      all mine; and, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is
      France, and you are mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      That puts her head all in a whirl, and she says, with a slight frown: "I
      cannot tell vat is dat." But the lover soon explains all that he wants her
      to understand and receives her promise to marry him. Placing a superb ring
      of great value upon her finger, Henry kisses his lady-love and thus ends
      the ceremony of betrothal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following month they were married; but this event did not put an end
      to the war, for the honeymoon was passed amidst a series of sieges and
      bloodshed, and there is no account of Katherine's once interceding with
      her husband for her wretched country. If she had not been selfish in her
      happiness she might have spared much misery to others. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link275" id="link275">275</a></span>After the
      siege of Melun, Henry had Queen Isabeau proclaimed regent of France, so
      that he might visit England to show off his pretty bride and have her
      crowned. First they made a triumphal' entry into Paris, where rich
      presents were offered to the youthful queen, and the rejoicings were on a
      most magnificent scale. The young couple spent Christmas in that city, and
      went on the 1st of February to Calais, where they embarked for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1421.</span> Towards the end of the month
      Katherine was crowned at Westminster Abbey and then conducted to the great
      hall, where a feast was served to a large party of noble ladies and
      gentlemen. But this feast had to be prepared without meat of any kind, for
      it was Lent, and called for a great deal of ingenuity on the part of the
      caterers. Each course was contrived to express some political meaning, the
      motto of explaining it being always attached to the most prominent dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only instance of active benevolence that we hear of Katherine took
      place at this feast, when she asked her husband to give James I. of
      Scotland, who was a prisoner and sat at the table, his liberty. Henry
      consented on condition that the king would go with him to fight in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young queen went to live at Windsor, where her husband would have
      joined her, but he was compelled to go back to France to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the siege of Meaux that news was brought him of the birth of
      a son. "Where was the boy born?" he asked eagerly, and when he was told
      "at Windsor," he repeated the following prophetic verse, which shows not
      only that he must have been very superstitious, but that he was a wretched
      poet:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "I, Henry, born at Monmouth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Shall small time reign and much get;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But Henry of Windsor shall long reign and lose all;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But as God will, so be it."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link276" id="link276">276</a></span> Henry
      requested that the child should not be born at Windsor, because he had
      some mysterious belief that bad luck hung over that palace, but Katherine
      had not chosen to obey him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following spring she wrote a loving letter to her lord, declaring that
      she longed to see him, and he immediately wrote her to join him in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      She landed at Harfleur with an army of twenty thousand men, who were to
      assist in fighting against her unhappy country. Her father and mother
      advanced with Henry V. to meet her, and the reunion was a source of great
      joy to them all. No doubt the king wanted to see his little baby, but it
      had been left in England, and he was never to have that great pleasure.
      His health had been failing for a long time, but amidst the excitement of
      war he would not allow himself rest until he could no longer stand.
      Shortly after his wife's arrival he was carried on a litter to the castle
      in the wood of Vincennes, where she was stopping, and where he spent his
      last hours on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1422.</span> When he was dying, he said to the
      Duke of Bedford: "Comfort my dear wife, the most afflicted creature
      living."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was not twenty-one years old when her husband died, and her
      grief was most violent, for she loved him devotedly. She made all the
      funeral arrangements herself, and they were conducted with great pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body was laid on a chariot drawn by four black horses. Above it was a
      bed on which lay a figure made of leather, and painted to resemble the
      dead king. On the head of this figure was a crown of gold and precious
      stones, and around the body a purple robe lined and trimmed with ermine.
      In the right hand was a sceptre, in the left a globe of gold with a cross
      rising from it. The face was uncovered, and a canopy superbly decorated
      was held above it. The

      Scots and a number of princes, lords, and knights followed in deep
      mourning. Four hundred armed knights rode around the car with their lances
      pointing downward, and these were followed by a company of men clothed in
      white bearing lighted torches. The queen with her retinue came about a
      mile behind. When the procession reached London it was met by fifteen
      bishops, a score of abbots, and a vast crowd of priests and people. They
      proceeded along the streets chaunting hymns for their dead king. After his
      burial Katherine raised a magnificent tomb to his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little prince was just eight months old when his mother returned to
      him at Windsor, where she spent the first few weeks of her widowhood. When
      parliament met, four months later, she removed to London and passed
      through the city on a throne drawn by white horses and surrounded by all
      the princes and nobles of England. With her infant on her lap, the young
      mother looked very pretty and interesting, and it is said that the little
      fellow behaved remarkably well. As he grew up he was present each year at
      the opening of parliament, and when he reached the age of seven the Earl
      of Warwick was appointed his tutor. He was crowned at Westminster, and
      afterwards the ceremony was repeated at Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime his mother had become reconciled to the loss of her
      husband, and had married one Owen Tudor, with whom she lived very
      privately. After Henry V. died, the English met with many disasters in
      France, for there was nobody to lead them as this great warrior had done.
      This was a cause of deep sorrow to Katherine, and, with other anxieties,
      broke down her health. She died on the 3d of January, 1437, and was buried
      in "Our Lady's Chapel" at Westminster Abbey.

      CHAPTER XVIII. MARGARET OF ANJOU, QUEEN OF HENRY VI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1429-1479.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>argaret was the
      last of the Provençal Queens of England, and she filled a most important
      position for more than a quarter of a century. Through her mother she was
      a direct descendant of the great Emperor Charlemagne, and her father, René
      of Anjou, was the son of the King of Sicily and Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1431.</span> When she was about two years old her
      father fought a battle against Anthony of Vaudemonte, and was taken
      prisoner. This battle was to decide who was to rule over Lorraine, and as
      René was captured he was handed over to the Duke of Burgundy, who locked
      him up in the top of a high tower at Dijon. While there the royal captive
      amused himself with painting on glass; some of the beautiful specimens of
      his art were preserved, and are still to be seen in the chapel of the
      Castle of Dijon.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the imprisonment of her husband, which lasted a long time,
      Margaret's mother was left with the entire care of their four young
      children, two boys and two girls, all of whom were remarkably pretty and
      interesting. Many months passed, and at last René was granted permission
      to leave the prison on condition that he would consent to the marriage of
      his elder daughter, Yolante, then in her ninth year, with Frederic of
      Vaudemonte, the son of the man by whom he had been made a captive. She was
      to have for her dowry part of the disputed lands
    </p>

      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link283" id="link283">283</a></span>of
      Lorraine. Besides, René had to pledge himself to pay a heavy ransom to the
      Duke of Burgundy, to give his two sons as hostages, and to allow Yolante
      to go and live with her new mother-in-law. At the same time, the baby
      Margaret was promised in marriage to Pierre, Count of St. Pol, but in
      consideration of her youth she was permitted to stay at home. So out of
      their four children these unhappy parents took back only one to Nancy,
      where they were living.
    </p>
    <p>
      All René's efforts to raise the ransom failed, and there was nothing left
      for him to do but to deliver himself up at last and go back to prison. His
      son John went with him, while Louis, the younger one, was restored to his
      distressed mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years passed away, and Louis, King of Naples, died. René was his
      rightful successor, and his faithful wife immediately took steps to claim
      the throne for him. She was a woman of superior talent, courage, and
      energy, and as she lived at the time when the renowned Joan of Arc was
      flourishing, it did not appear in any way odd or strange that she should
      fight for her rights. She at once assumed the title of Queen of the Two
      Sicilies, and went to live in the Castle of Tarascon, on the banks of the
      river Rhone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her two children became such pets among the Provençals, who loved their
      captive prince, that they were almost worshipped. Every time they went out
      the people would follow them in crowds, sing and strew flowers in their
      path, and present them with offerings of wreaths. At night they would
      light bonfires in front of the castle, because there was a superstition
      among them that it was the way to keep off pestilence. Once when a band of
      people, calling themselves witches and fairies, came with the crowd to see
      the pretty children, they were all burned alive, the ignorant of those
      times believing that pestilence was brought by the magic of such
      creatures. Notwith<span class="pagenum"><a name="link284" id="link284">284</a></span>standing
      this precaution a plague really did break out, and the queen was obliged
      to hurry away with her little ones. They embarked at Marseilles and went
      to Naples, where there was an ancient palace belonging to the family of
      Anjou.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen then had her husband proclaimed King of the Two Sicilies. At
      this ceremony she was seated with her children in the chair of state,
      which was covered with velvet embroidered with gold, and borne through the
      streets of Naples. She never ceased working until she obtained her
      husband's freedom, and witnessed his grand entry into Naples on a stately
      white charger, followed by a Provençal army.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1435.</span> In the treaty for his liberation the
      following very remarkable article, proposed by the Duke of Burgundy,
      appears:&mdash;"And to cement the peace between the two powers, Margaret
      of Anjou, second daughter of King René, shall espouse the young King of
      England." Margaret was then only six years of age. Her parents removed to
      a magnificent palace, where she and her brother Louis pursued their
      studies together for several years. Then Louis died and Margaret
      experienced in this loss her first real sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      King René's territories fell into the hands of the English, and he was
      reduced to such poverty that he retired with his family to Lorraine, where
      he spent his time writing verses and composing music that was the delight
      of all Europe. It was he who invented the opera ballet, and while thus
      pleasantly engaged he bore his trials with perfect indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Margaret's engagement with St. Pol was broken off on
      account of the prospect of an alliance with the King of England. She had
      become a beautiful girl, and had created quite a sensation at the court of
      her <span class="pagenum"><a name="link285" id="link285">285</a></span>aunt,
      the Queen of France, by her wit and accomplishments. When Henry VI. heard
      of her charms he sent a gentleman to find out if they had not been
      exaggerated, and at the same time to bring him a correct portrait of the
      Lady Margaret. The messenger returned with an eloquent description of her,
      partly because it was really deserved, and partly because he, as well as
      many persons of both the English and the French nations, hoped that this
      alliance would bring about a lasting peace between their countries. Henry
      was then in his four-and-twentieth year, good-looking, with a cultivated,
      refined mind, and excellent morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1444.</span> In 1444, commissioners met to arrange
      a treaty of peace, which was to be strengthened by the marriage of Henry
      and Margaret. When King René's consent was asked he gave it on condition
      that the dominions of Anjou and Maine were returned to him. This was
      granted by Henry and his council, and neither money nor lands were
      required for a dowry with the bride, her beauty and talents being
      considered sufficient "to outweigh all the riches in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some opposition made to this marriage by the Duke of Gloucester
      and his party, who did not want peace with France, nor a daughter of the
      house of Anjou on their throne; but it was all arranged in spite of them,
      and the Duke of Suffolk sailed from England with a splendid train of
      nobility to conduct Margaret to her future home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage ceremony was performed at Nancy in presence of the bride's
      parents, the royal family of France, and a large number of nobles and
      ladies. King Henry was not present, but Suffolk stood in his place, and
      married the Lady Margaret in the name of the Sovereign of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      King René gave a grand tournament in honor of the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link286" id="link286">286</a></span>marriage, and all the princely
      knights and gallant warriors wore garlands of daisies out of compliment to
      the bride, who had chosen this flower for her emblem. The festivities
      lasted eight days, and were attended by most of the nobles of France,
      England, and Burgundy. Margaret's sister, Yolante, was married at the same
      time, and this is how it was managed: she had been engaged to Frederic of
      Vaudemonte for more than nine years, but as her father had been forced to
      agree to this engagement when he was a prisoner he never intended to
      fulfil it. But the lover was not to be put off any longer, so he made a
      plan with some of his daring young friends to carry off his lady-love
      while the tournament was going on. King René was very angry at first, but
      soon forgave the young couple, and the festivities continued with fresh
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the week Margaret took a mournful farewell of her weeping
      family and friends, by whom she was deeply loved. Her uncle, Charles VII.
      of France, went part of the way with her. At parting, he pressed her in
      his arms tenderly, and said, with his eyes full of tears: "I seem to have
      done nothing for you, my dear niece, in placing you on one of the greatest
      thrones in Europe, for it is scarcely worthy of possessing you." The young
      queen was sobbing so that she could not reply, and they parted never to
      meet again. Her father went with her still further, and when they embraced
      in farewell they could not speak, but turned away from each other with
      hearts too full to permit of their uttering a single word.

      The wars with France that had lasted so long had made Henry so poor that
      he was obliged to call a meeting of parliament, when his bride was coming,
      to get money to defray the expenses of his wedding and Margaret's
      coronation, and for the same purpose he pawned some of the crown jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young queen had been so ill on the voyage that she <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link287" id="link287">287</a></span>had to be
      carried from the boat to the shore. A terrible storm was raging when she
      landed, but in spite of the thunder and lightning, people flocked in
      crowds to look at her. It was many days before she could proceed on her
      journey, because her illness proved to be something that looked very like
      small-pox. However, it could not have been a very severe case, because her
      beauty was not impaired in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1445.</span> She was able to join her husband at
      last, and their nuptials were solemnized at Tichfield Abbey, in April,
      1445. The bridal ring contained a ruby of great value, and had been a
      present to the king from his uncle, Cardinal Beaufort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Margaret's wardrobe was so scanty that Henry was obliged to buy her
      some clothing before she could appear in public. This to a girl of
      fifteen, who probably expected a fine trousseau when she married at least,
      must have been distressing. Although the English were dissatisfied because
      their new queen brought no dower, and because of her relation to the royal
      family of France, her beauty won its way to their hearts, and secured for
      her a hearty welcome where ever she appeared. All the knights and nobles
      wore her emblem flower, the daisy, in their caps, when they came in a body
      to receive her in state. This must have been a very flattering compliment,
      and the king carried it still further by having "Marguerites" engraved on
      his silver. Grand preparations had been made in London for the young
      queen's reception; there were triumphal arches across the principal
      streets bearing mottoes and beautiful designs in flowers, besides banners
      and evergreens. At every corner there were pictures or dressed-up figures
      having some political meaning, or offering some mark of welcome and
      loyalty to the new sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large procession of men on horseback conducted her <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link288" id="link288">288</a></span>into the city.' These consisted
      of, first, the Duke of Gloucester with five hundred attendants, all
      wearing his badge and livery; then the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs in
      blue gowns with embroidered sleeves and red hoods. Next came the queen's
      carriage, surrounded by her suite, and a long train of followers brought
      up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coronation took place at Westminster two days later with great
      splendor, though the king's treasury was almost empty. No doubt all this
      display was very gratifying to King René's faithful steward, squire, and
      minstrels, who came to England to witness the reception of their princess,
      then went back home to tell all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after the coronation an embassy arrived with congratulations
      to Henry VI. from the King of France, and René, Margaret's father. Henry
      received them seated in a large chair of state covered with blue tapestry.
      His long robe of scarlet velvet with gold embroidery swept the floor. When
      the ambassadors made their speech, wishing him the blessings of peace and
      prosperity, he raised his hat and said, several times: "St. John, thanks;
      great thanks to St. John!" They then inquired after the health of the
      young queen, and expressed a hope that the peace then existing between
      France and England would last forever. Henry replied: "That he desired the
      continuance of peace beyond anything on earth;" to which all who were
      present answered, "Amen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first two years after Margaret's marriage, Cardinal Beaufort was
      her chief adviser, and she became so fond of him that she would often make
      visits at his house in Waltham Forest, where there was a room
      magnificently fitted up for her special use with hangings of spun gold
      from Damascus. Henry was attached to the good cardinal also, and was
      always glad to be guided by his advice. He was of the greatest assistance
      to the young couple on several <span class="pagenum"><a name="link289"
      id="link289">289</a></span>occasions, for his immense wealth enabled him
      to help them out of many a debt that they could not otherwise have paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Margaret was a woman of unusual intellect and grace of
      manners. One of the chroniclers of her reign says of her: "England had
      never seen a queen more worthy of a throne than Margaret of Anjou. No
      woman surpassed her in beauty, and few men equalled her in courage. It
      seemed as if she had been formed by Heaven to supply to her royal husband
      the qualities which he required in order to become a great king."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity that she was called to share the throne of England when she
      was so young, for her judgment was not formed, and she had a nature that
      was more likely to create enemies than friends. She was very foolish in
      her treatment of the Duke of Gloucester, Henry's uncle, who, she knew, had
      been one of those most strongly opposed to her marriage. For this she
      could not forgive him, and, like a spoiled child, took every opportunity
      of showing him what influence she had over the king, and how much she
      loved Cardinal Beaufort and the Duke of Suffolk, both of whom were his
      sworn enemies. But there was a great change in her life by the time she
      had been two years on the throne, for Henry's ministers met in parliament,
      and decided on the destruction of the Duke of Gloucester. He had shown a
      disposition to join the Duke of York for the purpose of opposing the queen
      and her influence in every possible way. Although the king had no
      particular evidence to offer against his uncle, he was convinced that he
      was his enemy, and had him arrested for high treason. The whole country
      was astonished at this charge, but the astonishment was changed to horror,
      when, seventeen days later, the Duke of Gloucester was found dead in his
      bed. Murder was suspected, but there was no proof of it. Some people even
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link290" id="link290">290</a></span>accused
      the queen of having had a hand in it, but it is not at all probable that
      so young a girl, and one of Margaret's open, candid nature, could have
      been guilty of so foul a deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight weeks later the venerable Cardinal Beaufort died, and the young
      queen was thus deprived of a friend and adviser, whose large experience
      and profound wisdom had made his counsel so valuable to her. This was,
      indeed, a most serious loss, for Henry had not the qualities requisite for
      the government of a kingdom, and this duty, therefore, fell upon the
      shoulders of Margaret, who was so young that she had scarcely learned to
      govern herself. The king was absorbed in his studies and in the regulation
      of the college at Eton, that he had just founded. Affairs of state
      interested him but little, so his wife naturally turned for advice to the
      nearest friend of the departed cardinal. This was the Duke of Suffolk, a
      gray-haired statesman and soldier, who had served in the English army for
      thirty-four years. He was also a member of the king's cabinet, and his
      wife was Margaret's favorite maid of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the interval of peace that the English nation enjoyed before they
      were again forced into war, Margaret laid the foundation for Queen's
      College. She also tried to get the people interested in the manufacture of
      woollen and silk goods that had been commenced there many years before,
      but the desire for fighting had grown so that it was impossible to make
      those men or their sons who had fought in France, till the soil or weave
      cloth. The silk manufacture was chiefly carried on by women, while the men
      thirsted for the excitement of war in spite of its miseries.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1449.</span> In 1449 Charles VII. renewed
      hostilities, and in the course of two years had got back most of the towns
      in Normandy. The Duke of York and his party blamed "that French woman," as
      they contemptuously <span class="pagenum"><a name="link291" id="link291">291</a></span>called
      Margaret, for all their losses, and declared that the king was fit for a
      cloister rather than a throne, since he left all the affairs of his
      kingdom in the hands of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of York made himself so offensive to Margaret that she resolved
      to get rid of him at any cost; she therefore appointed him governor of
      Ireland. This was a serious mistake, for it only increased his power. He
      left a strong party in England who were opposed to the queen, though not
      openly, and did everything to make her and her favorite minister
      unpopular. They never ceased their efforts until they saw the Duke of
      Suffolk first imprisoned, then banished, and finally put to death by his
      enemies in defiance of the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tragedy was the first of many scenes of blood and horror that were in
      store for England. The misery of the lower classes caused by famine and
      disease was so great that they rose in rebellion, headed by Jack Cade, who
      gathered his rough motley forces about him at Blackheath. They numbered
      fifteen thousand, but when they heard that King Henry was coming in person
      to fight them, they got frightened, and fled to a place called Seven Oaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity that Queen Margaret went with her husband, for although she
      became warlike later in life, she was so little disposed to fight at that
      time that no sooner had Henry gained a victory than she persuaded him to
      go back with her to London. She could scarcely have committed a greater
      error, for the rebels mistook the king's departure for cowardice, and
      marched straight to the metropolis, where there is no telling what they
      would have done had not the churchmen interfered and calmed the storm. At
      their approach the king and queen fled to Kenilworth Castle, and the
      archbishop took it upon himself to pardon the rebels if they would return
      in peace to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1450.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link292" id="link292">292</a></span>Cade was not pardoned, but when
      he found himself deserted by his followers he made his escape. A thousand
      pounds were offered for his head, and the sheriff of Kent, who caught him,
      obtained the reward. It was afterwards proved that the Duke of York was at
      the bottom of this revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royal couple had now taken the Duke of Somerset into their favor, and
      though he was exceedingly unpopular in England he succeeded to Suffolk's
      high office. He belonged to the house of Lancaster, and it is said that
      his violent temper caused the beginning of those dreadful "wars of the
      roses" that lasted for twenty years. He had a dispute with Warwick in the
      Temple Gardens, and plucked a red rose, calling on all the bystanders who
      sided with him to do likewise. Warwick chose a white rose, and did the
      same, and forever after the two parties of York and Lancaster were
      distinguished by this sign. Instead of endeavoring to settle the dispute,
      Queen Margaret wore the red rose, and very imprudently declared herself an
      opponent of the other party.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time the Duke of York became so powerful that the queen advised her
      husband to make an attack on him. He consented, and marched toward the
      Welsh border, but he was too weak to take a firm stand as he ought to have
      done to crush his enemy, and consented to an interview with York, who
      demanded that Somerset should first be put under arrest. Henry consented.
      York then disbanded his army and entered the king's tent quite alone. In
      the meantime the queen had contrived to get Somerset out of the Tower
      without Henry's knowledge. She then concealed him behind a curtain of the
      royal tent, so that he might be present at the interview. When York
      assured the king that he had taken up arms for the sole purpose of
      bringing Somerset to punishment, the concealed duke rushed from

      hiding-place and accused his enemy of treason. A fierce quarrel ensued,
      during which the king stood speechless with astonishment. As York left the
      tent he was put under arrest, probably by the queen's order; but later,
      when he swore fealty to the king at St. Paul's Cathedral, he was released.

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1452.</span> About this time Talbot, Earl of
      Shrewsbury, one of Margaret's most devoted friends, was killed in battle.
      A magnificent volume of sketches that he presented to her shows that he
      must have had great taste for the fine arts. The colored title-page
      represents the king and queen seated side by side on a low divan. Margaret
      wears a royal crown; her hair is of a pale golden color, and falls
      gracefully over her shoulders. Her mantle is of royal purple, fastened
      with gems and bands of gold. She is beautiful and majestic in this
      picture, and does not appear more than twenty years old. Talbot kneels
      before her presenting the volume, with his dog by his side. Daisies are
      painted in clusters on the title-page, and the queen's initial (M) is
      surrounded by the garter and its motto. The ladies in attendance who stand
      behind the divan wear heart-shaped caps, formed of a stuffed roll
      ornamented with gold and jewels, and fastened in a fanciful turban shape
      over a close cap of gold cloth or net-work brought to a point in front and
      rising at the back of the head. At the end of the volume is an allegorical
      picture representing Margaret and the ladies of her court as the Virtues.
      Margaret is Faith and King Henry appears as Honor. The old earl was
      mourned by all classes of people, for he was the greatest captain of the
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1453.</span> It was in this year that the queen's
      dearly loved mother died, and a still heavier calamity fell upon the royal
      household in the fearful malady that began to show itself in the king. He
      had inherited the brain disease <span class="pagenum"><a name="link296"
      id="link296">296</a></span>of his grandfather, Charles VI. of France, and
      the trouble in his court had so affected him that his reason gave way
      under it. Margaret was therefore compelled to govern alone, whether she
      desired it or no, and, like a good wife, she made every effort to keep her
      poor ailing husband in ignorance of all political disturbance. She had him
      removed to his palace at Westminster, where he could be quiet and kept
      free from all excitement, and it was there that his only child, the
      unfortunate Edward of Lancaster, called "The child of sorrow," was born.
      This boy was named Edward, and was York's only rival to the throne. He was
      therefore not welcome to the nation, who felt that his existence would be
      the cause of much bloodshed between the two parties of York and Lancaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this period Queen Margaret was ruling, with the assistance of Cardinal
      Kemp, Archbishop of Canterbury, but he died a few months after the prince
      was born, and the House of Lords sent a committee to the king to request
      him to name a successor. But poor Henry stared at them without
      understanding a word they said, and of course could make no reply. The
      Duke of York was then appointed defender and protector of the king as long
      as his illness lasted, or until Prince Edward should be old enough to
      ascend the throne. Five physicians and surgeons were appointed to attend
      the royal sufferer and watch over his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was so wrapped up in her baby, and so worried on account of her
      husband's condition, that she took no part in these political changes, but
      her party insisted on her having absolute power as queen regent. York
      objected, and had the Duke of Somerset put under arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later the king's consciousness suddenly returned, and he
      seemed as though awakening from a deep sleep. His child was then shown to
      him, and he noticed <span class="pagenum"><a name="link297" id="link297">297</a></span>

      for the first time, although he was more than a year old. the news of the
      cardinal's death brought tears to his eyes, and he said 'that he never
      knew of it till this time,' and 'that one of the wisest lords in the land
      was dead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was great rejoicing over the king's recovery, and Margaret
      immediately took measures to have him restored to power. Though still
      weak, he attended parliament and replaced Somerset in office. But this
      triumph of the queen's party did not last long, for the Duke of York
      raised an army and marched towards London, intending to take the king by
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had courage, but he could not bear to shed the blood of his
      subjects; however, there was no help for it now, so he made his
      headquarters at St. Albans, with not more than two thousand men. The Earl
      of Warwick commenced the attack, and the battle, which lasted only one
      hour, was a desperate one, large numbers being slain on both sides. The
      king was wounded in the neck, but continued to fight until left alone
      under the royal banner. He then walked coolly to a baker's shop close by
      to have the wound attended to. The Duke of York followed him, and falling
      on his knees before the sovereign, said: "Rejoice! for the traitor,
      Somerset, is slain." Henry replied: "For God's sake stop the slaughter of
      my subjects." York then took the wounded king by the hand and led him to
      his apartments in the abbey of St. Albans. On the following day they went
      together to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the approach of the Duke of York's army Margaret had retired to
      Greenwich with her ladies and the little prince, where she awaited the
      result of the battle of St. Albans with great anxiety; and when the news
      came of the defeat of her party, and the death of so many of her brave
      friends, she fainted and remained in a stupor for several hours. The
      king's wound was so serious that, added to <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link300" id="link300">300</a></span>the excitement of the battle, it
      brought a return of his disease. He was not in a condition to attend the
      next parliament, so the Duke of York appeared in his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a parliament made up of the queen's enemies, who naturally found
      great fault with her management of public affairs. They petitioned the
      king to appoint the Duke of York protector of the realm, and urged him so
      often and strongly to this step that at last he consented. No sooner was
      this done than the queen was advised to withdraw to some quiet spot with
      her husband and child. She was glad to comply, for her mind was so filled
      with these objects of her care that she did not feel capable of any other
      duties. She removed to Greenwich Palace, where she devoted herself to the
      nursing of the king and the education of her boy. But while there she
      received frequent visits from the princes of the Lancaster family and the
      young Tudors, Henry's half brothers. Besides these, a band of brave young
      nobles and gentlemen gathered around her, panting to avenge the blood of
      their fathers who had fallen at St. Albans. These so strengthened the Red
      Rose party that as soon as the king's health improved Margaret felt it her
      duty to present him again at parliament. She therefore held a meeting of
      her friends and made all the arrangements for this step.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1456.</span> When King Henry entered the House of
      Lords, and addressed them in a calm, dignified speech, telling them that
      since by the blessing of God his health was so far restored that the
      kingdom no longer needed a protector, they were so taken by surprise that
      they immediately consented to his resuming the reins of government. The
      Duke of York had not heard of this new move of Queen Margaret's, and
      happened to be absent. When an order reached him next day, signed by the
      king, requesting him to resign his office, he was so chagrined that he
      retired to <span class="pagenum"><a name="link301" id="link301">301</a></span>the
      country. Henry Beaufort, heir to the late Duke of Somerset, was then
      appointed prime minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor queen had her hands full, for not only was she obliged to keep
      constantly prompting her husband how to act, but she took great pains to
      amuse him and to preserve in him a calm, peaceful state of mind. Minstrels
      were gathered from all parts of the country, and well paid for reciting
      and playing to him, and daily requests came from nobles and other subjects
      for leave to go on pilgrimages to the different shrines to pray for his
      health. This had a very soothing influence and filled King Henry's mind
      with hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret showed a great deal of wisdom and prudence in the way she
      exercised her power at this time, and feeling a desire to know whether she
      was popular with her subjects, she resolved to travel with the king and
      the little prince through some of the midland counties and spend a short
      time at Coventry. Everywhere the royal party were received with great
      enthusiasm, and processions were got up in their honor. Margaret won her
      way to all hearts that were not prejudiced against her, and during her
      stay at Coventry the citizens became so devoted to her that the name of
      their town was changed to "Margaret's Safe Harbor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the French and Scotch thought that as there were two parties in
      England it was a good time to attack them, but they made a great mistake,
      for although the nation were divided among themselves, they became one as
      soon as a foreign power dared to attack them. A general congress of the
      two parties was called, and presided over by the lord-mayor, who was
      appointed guardian of the public peace. A treaty was formed after two
      months of debate and quarrel, when the king and queen made a public entry
      into London. The feast of the Annunciation was kept as a day of public
      thanksgiving for the peace that reigned between the houses of York and
      Lancaster, and when the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link302"
      id="link302">302</a></span>procession was formed to march to St. Paul's
      Cathedral, the earls who had been the deadliest foes headed it, walking
      arm in arm. The king followed alone, and just behind him came the Duke of
      York, leading Margaret by the hand. All appeared to be on the most loving
      terms, and the happiness of the citizens of London manifested itself in
      their cheering, bonfires and other signs of rejoicing. This patched-up,
      make-believe peace lasted only a short time, for the Duke of York was at
      that time lord admiral of the whole English navy, and with so much power
      he was not likely to remain long inactive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1459.</span> The following year the queen made a
      tour through some of the counties of England with her husband, for the
      benefit of his health, as she said, though her real object was to gain
      favor for her son, then a most engaging child of six years. So well did
      she succeed that at the battle of Bloreheath, which was fought shortly
      after, ten thousand men wore the Prince of Wales' livery. King Henry was
      dangerously ill when this battle was fought. The Yorkists were victorious,
      and their leader boldly asserted his right to the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret was not crushed by defeat; on the contrary, her energies were
      aroused, and she determined to take up arms herself to fight the cause of
      her husband and son. The warlike blood of Charlemagne was thrilling in her
      veins, and she was the countrywoman of Joan of Arc, who had proved herself
      such a successful warrior. She went to Coventry, where she succeeded in
      getting together another army. By this time the king's health had so far
      improved that she persuaded him to march to Ludlow and meet the Duke of
      York on the battle-field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Margaret had so increased her popularity that many of the
      Yorkist soldiers refused to fight against her husband. The duke was taken
      aback at this, and circulated <span class="pagenum"><a name="link303"
      id="link303">303</a></span>a report of the king's death, and caused a mass
      to be sung in camp for the repose of his soul. Hearing of this, the queen
      caused a pardon to be proclaimed in the king's name for all who would
      return to their allegiance. The Yorkist leaders did not believe in this
      offer of pardon until Henry, urged on by his courageous wife, advanced to
      the very gates of Ludlow Castle and proclaimed it again. Then so many
      soldiers of the other side deserted that the duke made his escape and went
      to Calais, leaving his wife and her two younger sons to defend the castle.
      They were taken prisoners, and the whole town was destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was delighted with the success of her first campaign, but she did
      not enjoy her triumph very long, for the Earl of Warwick, who was a more
      determined enemy than York, brought a band of experienced soldiers from
      Calais, and gathering all his forces, made a tremendous charge on the
      Lancaster troops, killing ten thousand of them in two short hours, and
      capturing King Henry. The queen was stationed near enough to receive the
      dreadful news within an hour, and made her escape with her son to a
      fortress in the north of Wales, where she was honorably received and
      protected by a courageous chieftain of that country. Nobody knew where she
      was hidden, not even the king, who was taken to London and carefully
      guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as York heard of the victory of his party he entered the city of
      London at the head of five hundred horsemen, with a sword of state borne
      before him. He rode straight to Westminster, and, entering the House of
      Lords, walked to the throne, and laid his right hand on it with a look
      around among the peers that implied he awaited an invitation to take his
      seat there. Not a word was spoken. At length the Archbishop of Canterbury
      broke the dead silence, and asked him, "if he would be pleased to visit
      the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know of no one in the realm who <span class="pagenum"><a name="link304"
      id="link304">304</a></span>ought not rather to visit me," he replied,
      haughtily, and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peers then referred it to Henry to decide whether he or the Duke of
      York had the legal claim to the throne. He replied: "My father was king;
      his father was also king; I have worn the crown forty years from my
      cradle; you have all sworn fealty to me as your sovereign, and your
      fathers have done the like to my father and grandfather. How, then, can my
      right be disputed?" Nevertheless, the king agreed that if he were
      permitted to wear the crown during his life, he would resign it, at his
      death, to the Duke of York or his heirs. He was next compelled to order
      the return of his wife and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the fire in Margaret's nature was aroused at hearing how the rights of
      her boy had been surrendered, but she was without an army, and what could
      she do? Suddenly it occurred to her to seek assistance from the King of
      Scotland. He was the son of a Lancaster princess, and his wife was a
      friend and relation of Margaret. She caused a report to be circulated that
      she was raising an army in France, then went secretly to Scotland, and
      within eight days after her husband's order for return had been received
      she crossed the Scottish border at the head of the forces she had gathered
      there, and unfurled the banner of the Red Rose. Her numbers were increased
      by knights from all the northern counties of England, and before the
      leaders of the White Rose party were aware of her being in the country at
      all, she presented herself at the gates of York.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke was so taken by surprise at this bold movement on the part of the
      queen that he shut himself up in his strong Castle of Sandal to await the
      arrival of his son. But Margaret followed him up, and defied him day after
      day to meet her in the field, calling him a coward for being afraid of a
      woman, until he arranged his forces for battle, hoping to

      her away. He soon saw his mistake though, for Margaret was not in the
      least daunted at the sight of his warriors. She did not play the Amazon
      herself by fighting, but she directed her own forces, under the command of
      Somerset, in such a way as to enclose the Yorkists from all sides in a
      net, as it were, and in less than half an hour two thousand of them lay
      dead on the field, the duke himself among the number. Lord Clifford cut
      off the dead leader's head, crowned it with paper, and presented it on the
      point of his lance to Queen Margaret, saying: "Madam, your war is done;
      here is your king's ransom."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shuddered at first and turned away, then suddenly remembering all the
      trouble this man had given her, she looked again and smiled in
      satisfaction. She then ordered the head to be placed over the gates of
      York, and that of the Earl of Salisbury, who was her prisoner, to be
      placed beside it, adding, that room must be left for those of the Earls of
      March, York's son, and Warwick, which she intended should keep them
      company. This was a grave mistake, and added much to the fury of her
      enemies, who stopped at no deed of cruelty and horror after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her next step was to try to rescue her husband, for which purpose she
      hurried on to London. But she was met at St. Alban's by Warwick's forces
      leading the king in their train. A furious battle ensued, but Margaret's
      stout northern soldiers were too much for the Londoners, and when night
      came all the Yorkists fled, leaving the king behind. One of his attendants
      hastened to the queen's quarters to inform her that her lord was near,
      whereupon she flew to embrace him. Accompanied by the Prince of Wales and
      some of the northern lords, they went to the Abbey church of St. Albans to
      return thanks to God for the king's deliverance. They were received by the
      abbot and monks, who prepared apartments for them in the abbey, where they
      remained for a while. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link308" id="link308">308</a></span>But
      Margaret's better feelings were all changed by the hard experience she had
      had, and in her desire for further vengeance she made so many mistakes
      that she turned the good-will of the Londoners towards her into hatred,
      and they refused to let her enter the city. So she removed with her troops
      towards the northern counties, her husband and son accompanying her. Then
      Edward of York entered London in triumph. He was received by the citizens
      as their deliverer, and proclaimed king by the voice of the people under
      the title of Edward IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was considered the death-blow to the house of Lancaster, but not by
      the persistent Margaret, who in the course of a few days rallied an army
      of sixty thousand men. Her generals, Somerset and Clifford, persuaded her
      to stay with her husband and son, while they engaged Edward and the Earl
      of Warwick, first at Ferrybridge and then at Towton. A heavy snow-storm
      that fell in the faces of the Lancastrians so blinded them that their
      arrows did not take effect, while those of their enemy covered the field
      with forty thousand of their dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret fled to Scotland, and Edward IV. forbade all his subjects under
      pain of death to hold any sort of communication with her or her husband;
      yet there were many faithful hearts ready to sacrifice life and fortune to
      the heroine of the Red Rose. She and Louis XI., then on the throne of
      France, were first cousins, and had been brought up together. To him she
      now turned for aid, but he received her coldly when she threw herself at
      his feet, merely offering her a sum of money providing she would give him
      Calais if she could not return it within a year. The people of England
      objected to this, and thought that as Calais was not hers to give she had
      committed treason in making the promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After five months' absence she returned to England with <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link309" id="link309">309</a></span>two thousand
      volunteers, obtained more assistance from the Scotch, and got possession
      of several important fortresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring the battle of Hexham was fought, the Yorkists being
      victorious. Margaret fled with her son to the nearest forest, where, after
      wandering about for awhile, she fell in with a gang of robbers, who stole
      everything of value that she had about her. While they were quarrelling
      over the division of the spoils, she snatched up her boy and ran away to
      the nearest thicket. When evening came on she crept out of her
      hiding-place, dreading above all things lest she might fall in with a band
      of Edward's troops, when by the light of the moon she beheld a robber of
      gigantic size advancing towards her with a drawn sword. Taking her son by
      the hand she bravely advanced towards the man with all her natural dignity
      of bearing and said: "Here, my friend, save the son of your king." The
      robber was struck with astonishment, and dropping his sword, offered to
      conduct them to a place of safety, telling the queen that he was a
      Lancastrian gentleman who had been ruined in King Henry's service. Taking
      the prince in his arms he led Queen Margaret to a cave in the forest,
      where his wife received them and provided refreshments. There the
      fugitives remained for two days. On the third their hiding-place was
      discovered by the devoted followers who were determined to stand by
      Margaret to the very end. These were Pierre de Brezé, one of her own
      countrymen, his squire, Barville, and an English gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1463.</span> From them Margaret heard of the
      escape of her husband and of the dreadful fate of her faithful friends,
      Somerset, Hungerford, and Roos, who had been captured and beheaded in the
      public market-place of Hexham without trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the hut of the generous outlaw, the queen <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link310" id="link310">310</a></span>thanked him and his wife with
      tears in her eyes. Her friends had offered them money, which they had
      refused, and Margaret had nothing left to give them. "Of all I have lost,"
      she said, "I regret nothing so much as the power to recompense such
      virtue." She then proceeded to Scotland, reaching there only after a great
      deal of hardship and danger, to find that her presence caused great
      uneasiness to the king, who feared that it might be the means of bringing
      him into trouble with England.
    </p>
    <p>
      She embarked for Flanders, where some of the ladies of the court had taken
      refuge, accompanied by the prince, the faithful de Brezé, and about two
      hundred of those ruined Lancastrians who still had faith in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she arrived at St. Pol, the Duke of Burgundy not only received her
      with honors and gave a festival to welcome her, but he also assisted her
      with money. To each of her ladies he presented a hundred crowns, to de
      Brezé, who had spent the whole of his fortune in Margaret's service, a
      thousand, and to the queen herself an order for twelve thousand crowns.
      This princely behavior on the part of the duke was like heaping coals of
      fire on Margaret's head, for she had always despised him, and had been
      heard to say more than once, "that if by any chance he were to fall into
      her hands she would make the axe pass between his head and his shoulders."
      He sympathized with her misfortunes, and entertained her in a way becoming
      her station, but he would give her no political aid nor allow any of his
      subjects to take part in her quarrel. As his guest she was welcome so long
      as she chose to stay, and when she left he provided her with an escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret next visited her sister Yolante, Countess of Vaudemonte, and then
      her father offered one of his ancient castles in Verdun for her residence,
      where, with a few of her ruined friends, she devoted herself to the
      education of the last tender bud of the Red Rose of Lancaster.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link313" id="link313">313</a></span>After
      King Henry's escape at the battle of Hexham, he wandered about, hiding
      himself in the house of one friend or another, but most of the time in a
      cave, until he was betrayed by a monk, and taken to London under arrest.
      There he was treated most brutally by a mob, and after being led through
      the streets by the Earl of Warwick, who kept shouting "Treason, treason,
      and behold the traitor!" he was locked up in the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that Edward IV. still feared Margaret's power in England, for he
      had the coasts guarded to prevent her return, and put to the torture
      several persons who were only suspected of having assisted her with money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years later there was a great change in the politics of England, and
      the Earl of Warwick took up arms to drive the king from his throne. But he
      failed and was obliged to fly to France, where Louis received him. Now
      Margaret's relations saw a chance for regaining for her the throne she had
      lost, so they all united in trying to bring about an interview between her
      and her bitter enemy. At first she shuddered at the thought of ever seeing
      him, but when he became very humble, offered the most plausible excuses
      for his conduct, and swore to defend her and her son with all the power he
      had once used in opposing them, she consented to pardon him and influenced
      her son to do the same. The Earl of Oxford also obtained her pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Edward was then eighteen years of age, and had fallen in love with
      Anne, the Earl of Warwick's second daughter. Margaret did all she could to
      oppose this match, but she was at last won over, and the marriage was
      solemnized the following August, 1470.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Warwick had raised an army to take to England, whither he
      went as soon as the wedding ceremonies were over. His wife, Queen
      Margaret, Prince Edward and his bride then went to Paris by invitation
      from
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XI. The streets of the city were magnificently decorated and hung
      with rich tapestry, and all the officers turned out in grand procession to
      conduct the royal party to the palace of St. Paul, that had been fitted up
      for their reception. It was there that news came of the landing of the
      Earl of Warwick in England, and of his success in liberating King Henry
      and placing him on the throne once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1471.</span> Then Margaret with all her party
      resolved to return. In February the preparations were completed, and the
      fleet set sail from Harfleur. But wind and weather were against them, and
      after three times being driven back to the coast of Normandy, with great
      damage to the ships, they resolved to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last they were able to sail again, they were sixteen days and
      nights making a voyage that usually took twelve hours. After landing, they
      repaired to an abbey, where they were celebrating Easter when the dreadful
      news came of the death of Warwick and the recapture of King Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life the poor queen was completely crushed, and
      wished she might die rather than live for the misery that was yet in store
      for her. Some of the Lancastrian nobles sought her out, and expressed
      their intention of continuing the fight against Edward IV., and at last so
      aroused her from the despondent state into which she had fallen that she
      consented to aid them. Placing herself at the head of an army that they
      had raised, she marched thirty-seven miles in one day, and met her enemy
      within a mile of Tewksbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all arrangements were made for the battle, Margaret rode about the
      field from rank to rank, encouraging the soldiers with promises of large
      rewards if they won the victory. It proved a sorry day for the Lancaster
      cause, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link315" id="link315">315</a></span>and
      when Queen Margaret saw her troops wofully defeated she fell down in a
      swoon. She was carried from the battlefield to a small convent near by,
      where her daughter-in-law and some of her ladies awaited her. She was thus
      spared witnessing the fall of her son, who was killed near the close of
      the battle; but when the dreadful truth was brought to her, she cursed
      King Edward and all his posterity in her agony of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was repeated to the king, he thought of putting her to death,
      but with a refinement of cruelty that was even worse, he forced her and
      the unfortunate Princess of Wales to take part in his triumphal entry to
      London. Margaret was then shut up in the dismal prison where her husband
      had been for five years, but she beheld him never again, for he was
      murdered the very night of her arrival in the gloomy fortress of the
      Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      King René sacrificed his inheritance of Provence to Louis XI. for the
      liberation of his daughter Margaret. Then an agreement having been made
      between the Kings of France and England for her ransom, in August, 1475,
      she landed in France, with three ladies and seven gentlemen sent by her
      father to escort her. Thirty years before she had left the shores of her
      native land a monarch's bride in all the pride and flush of youthful
      beauty; she returned a broken-hearted, childless widow, for whose
      afflictions it was treason to shed a tear.

      CHAPTER XIX. ELIZABETH WOODVILLE, QUEEN OF EDWARD IV.

      (A.D. 1431-1492.)

      Woodville was maid of honor to Queen Margaret of Anjou she little supposed
      that she would ever ascend the throne of England, yet that was her destiny
      not many years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, first, she became the wife of John Grey, son and heir of the wealthy
      Lord Ferrers, who owned the domain of Bradgate, where she lived until her
      husband's death. John Grey was a brave, handsome man of twenty-five when
      he married Elizabeth, and occupied the important position of leader of
      Queen Margaret's cavalry. He was killed at the second battle of St.
      Albans, leaving his young wife with two little children, named Thomas and
      Richard, both under four years of age. By the cruel fortunes of war these
      little ones were deprived of their inheritance of Bradgate, and so, with
      their mother, went to live at the Castle of Grafton, which belonged to the
      Duchess of Bedford, Elizabeth's mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when Edward IV. was hunting in the forest of Whittlebury, the
      young widow waylaid him, and throwing herself at his feet, pleaded
      earnestly for the restoration of Bradgate to her fatherless boys, who
      stood by her side. Struck by her beauty and downcast looks, the king
      listened attentively to her request, and not only granted it, but fell in
      love with her on the spot. This interview took place beneath the shade of
      a wide-spreading tree that is known to this day as the Queen's Oak.

      The king's mother became very angry when she heard of this unequal match,
      for she was queen at that period, and could not bear to resign her place
      to the daughter of a man who began his career as a poor squire. However,
      it was too late to lament, and in the autumn the bride was led by the
      young Duke of Clarence to the abbey-church of Reading, where the king took
      her by the hand, and presented her to the council of peers assembled there
      as his lawfully wedded wife. Elizabeth appeared that day in a dress of
      rich blue and gold brocade with a long, full train bordered with ermine.
      The sleeves and body were tight, and a band of ermine around the neck,
      and, passing down either side of the open skirt in front, displayed a rich
      satin petticoat. Over her yellow hair, which fell loosely down her back,
      she wore a lofty crown. A costly pearl necklace encircled her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Elizabeth soon gained unbounded influence over the mind of her
      husband, which she too frequently exerted for the advancement of her own
      relatives. She had a soft, caressing voice, and always assumed an air of
      humility, when desirous of gaining a point, that had its weight with
      Edward. The acknowledgment of the king's marriage was followed by a series
      of the most brilliant feasts and tournaments ever witnessed in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coronation of the new queen took place at Westminster Abbey, May 26th.
      That morning the king had knighted thirty-two citizens, who preceded the
      queen's litter on horseback. After the coronation, which was conducted
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link320" id="link320">320</a></span>with
      great solemnity, a grand banquet was held, the royal couple presiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was most unfortunate in soon incurring the ill-will of Warwick,
      the prime minister, who had been all-powerful in England for several
      years. It was increased by the influence gained through her
      instrumentality by the various members of her family. Before long, the
      popular rage was excited against the Woodvilles, and England was in a
      state of insurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1469.</span> The queen's father and one of her
      brothers concealed themselves in a forest, but were discovered and
      beheaded, without judge or jury. This was a dreadful blow to Elizabeth,
      who was warmly attached to her family. The king went north to inquire into
      the cause of the outrage, but could not get back for a long-time because
      Warwick and the Duke of Clarence kept him under a kind of restraint;
      however he escaped at last, and got back to London. Then Warwick and
      Clarence were so frightened at having interfered with the king's movements
      that they got away with their families as quickly as possible and went to
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the queen was safely lodged in the Tower. But it was not
      very long before Warwick returned to England, and Edward came so near
      falling into his hands again that he fled half-dressed one night just as
      the troops approached the castle, and embarked on board a ship at Lynn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was so alarmed for her own safety and that of her family that
      she went at once to a gloomy monastery, called the Sanctuary, where her
      mother and her three daughters, Elizabeth, Mary, and Cicely, accompanied
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1470.</span> It was there that the first son of
      Edward IV. was born. He was named after his father, and christened with as
      little ceremony as though he had been the son of the poorest man in the
      kingdom.

      time the little prince was five months old, the Duke of Clarence had
      parted from Warwick, and Edward returned to London, where he was warmly
      received. He hastened to meet his family, and removed them from the
      Sanctuary to his mother's palace, Castle Baynard. Several battles that he
      fought and won after his return put an end to so many of Edward's
      opponents&mdash;among them Warwick, the most formidable&mdash;that the
      house of York was at last firmly established in power and the rebellion
      crushed. Then followed several years of peace, when the royal family were
      settled at Windsor or at Westminster, holding court with great state and
      splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Edward's second son, Prince Richard, Duke of York, was born during
      this season of enjoyment, and when he was five years old he was formally
      married to Anne Mowbray, infant heiress of the Duchy of Norfolk, aged
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following spring the singular death of the Duke of Clarence occurred.
      He had been condemned to execution for an offence against the king, his
      brother, but one morning he was found drowned in a butt of malmsey.
      Clarence was in the habit of drinking to excess, and it was supposed that
      he fell into the butt of his favorite wine while in a state of
      intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1483.</span> In 1483 King Edward was seized with
      an attack of fever that resulted in death. After lying in state for
      several days his body was interred with great pomp in the Chapel of St.
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Elizabeth was left in a more unprotected state this time than when
      her first husband died. The young king was pursuing his studies at Ludlow
      Castle, under the care of her brother, Lord Rivers. Elizabeth proposed to
      the council that he should be at once escorted to London with a powerful
      army, but Lord Hastings, who presided, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link324" id="link324">324</a></span>could see no necessity for such
      a step, and so, unfortunately for young Edward, it was not taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Duke of Gloucester, who was in Scotland, caused Edward V. to
      be proclaimed at York, and wrote such a kind, deferential letter to the
      queen, that she felt she had a friend in this first prince of the blood.

    <p>
      The council then commanded Earl Rivers to bring the young king to London,
      and Elizabeth was eagerly awaiting him, when news was brought to her that
      the Dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham had met him with an armed force,
      seized his person, and arrested Earl Rivers and Lord Richard Grey, who
      were with him. The poor mother could scarcely believe such an astonishing
      report. As soon as the Archbishop of York heard what had happened, he took
      the great seal and carried it to Elizabeth, assuring her that if an
      attempt were made to crown anybody but her eldest son he would take it
      upon himself to crown Richard. But, when on the following day, he saw the
      Thames covered with boatloads of Gloucester's soldiers, placed there to
      watch the queen, he regretted what he had done, and went to the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link325" id="link325">325</a></span>Sanctuary,
      where Elizabeth had taken refuge with the Duke of York, to get the seal
      back again..
    </p>
    <p>
      The 4th of May had been appointed for the coronation of Edward V. He
      entered the city surrounded by a retinue of the Duke of Gloucester's
      officers, headed by the treacherous duke himself, and, under some
      pretence, was lodged in the royal apartments of the Tower, the coronation
      having been postponed for some trivial reason.

      Gloucester's next object was to get possession of Prince Richard. He would
      have taken him by force, but the Archbishop of Canterbury took it upon
      himself to persuade Elizabeth to give him up. This he accomplished, after
      a great deal of persuasion, by working upon her sympathies and telling her
      of the loneliness of her eldest son, Edward, who was pining for a
      playmate. At last it was agreed that the child should go to his brother
      until after the coronation, for which preparations were going on night and
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke of Gloucester intended that no such coronation should ever
      take place, so he brought shameful accusations against Elizabeth and her
      children, put several <span class="pagenum"><a name="link326" id="link326">326</a></span>of
      her adherents to death, and finally had himself crowned King of England on
      the 26th of June.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less than a month from that date the two little princes, whom he had
      kept shut up in the Tower, were murdered by his order. It is impossible to
      describe the agony of the poor mother when she learned the fate of her two
      dear little boys. She cried to God for vengeance on the wretch who had
      committed so foul a crime. Only a few months later Richard of Gloucester's
      only son, for whose advancement he had shed so much innocent blood, died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was forced to submit to the will of the usurper, whose acts of
      tyranny rendered her existence bitter in the extreme. But she lived to see
      her daughter Elizabeth on the throne of England, as the wife of Henry
      VII., and her own restoration to liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1492.</span> She died in 1492, attended in her
      last ill ness by the most affectionate care of her daughter. Her funeral
      was conducted with the utmost simplicity, and she was buried at St.
      George's Chapel, in the tomb with Edward IV. The monument is of steel,
      representing a double gate between two ancient Gothic towers. On a flat

      CHAPTER XX. ANNE OF WARWICK, QUEEN OF RICHARD III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1454-1485.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ew women living
      only to the age of thirty-one, have known as much suffering and sorrow as
      came to the lot of Anne of Warwick in that limited space of time. The
      greater part of her childhood was passed at Calais, but she was in England
      with her father, the Earl of Warwick, at intervals during the struggles
      between the houses of York and Lancaster, in which he took such a
      prominent part, and fled with him in terror after Edward IV. escaped from
      his clutches. The misery and danger of that flight to France came to an
      end at last, and then succeeded a few months of genuine happiness for this
      young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1470.</span> The treaty concluding her marriage
      with Edward of Lancaster having been duly concluded, Anne was united to
      him shortly after her return to France, only to be deprived of his beloved
      companionship within the year, for he was killed at the battle of
      Tewksbury, and she was left a widow at seventeen. The Duke of Gloucester,
      being Anne's cousin, had seen a great deal of her during her childhood,
      for they were nearly of the same age, and had shared each other's
      pastimes. But he had such a dreadful temper, and was, besides, so
      disagreeable, being humpbacked and ungainly, that Anne was not fond of
      him. He, on the contrary, was so much in love with her, that no sooner was
      she free to marry than he determined to make her his wife. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link328" id="link328">328</a></span>Being under
      the same charge of treason that included her mother and Queen Margaret,
      after the Duke of Gloucester, had assumed the reins of government, she was
      in his power. But she tried hard to elude his attentions and even went so
      far as to take a situation in a house in London disguised as a cook. The
      wily humpback found her out, however, and placed her in a convent for
      safe-keeping. After a time she was permitted to seek the protection of her
      uncle, the Archbishop of York, but his arrest left her again exposed to
      the persecutions of her hated cousin, who, by a series of wicked deeds,
      forced her at last to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1473.</span> The ceremony took place at
      Westminster in 1473, and then poor Anne was more unhappy than ever. She
      lived at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, where, for a time at least, she
      was rid of her hated tyrant of a husband, for he was engaged fighting the
      Scotch, and only returned after the death of Edward IV., as mentioned in
      the last reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1474 the son was born for whom the Earl of Gloucester had so foully
      steeped his soul in crime. This child was Anne's one source of comfort and
      joy, and on him she lavished all her affections.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after his return from Scotland the Duke of Gloucester started,
      as we have seen, with a troop of soldiers to intercept his nephew, Edward
      V., on his way to London, and proceeded with the hapless boy in his
      charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne joined her husband after he had caused the murder of his two nephews
      in the Tower, and shared the coronation for which he had committed so many
      shameful and outrageous deeds. The very preparations that had been made
      for the coronation of Edward V. served to grace that ceremony when his
      cruel uncle usurped his rights, and the same day Gloucester's son, Edward,
      was created Prince of Wales.

      banquet succeeded, and every detail of the entire ceremony was conducted
      with great splendor. Then the royal couple, attended by the prince, passed
      through the metropolis in procession and took up their abode at Windsor
      Castle. Later they kept court in grand style at Warwick Castle for a week,
      and afterwards travelled through the kingdom. At York these new sovereigns
      were crowned once more, and soon after Richard III. was recalled to London
      on account of an insurrection headed by the Duke of Buckingham. Anne
      accompanied him, leaving her son under the protection of friends in the
      north, where she thought he would be safer than in London. She never
      beheld the child again, for he died during her absence. The shock caused
      by this sudden and dreadful calamity so crushed the unfortunate mother
      that her health began to decline.

      than ever. He seemed anxious to be rid of her, and shed only a few
      hypocritical tears when she

      the daughter of Edward IV. and Elizabeth Woodville, whose secret marriage
      caused so much trouble. She was shut up in the sanctuary while her
      father's throne was in jeopardy, and danced at the balls given to
      celebrate his restoration. She was at that time only six years old, and
      when she reached the advanced age of nine her hand had been promised in
      marriage four times as a peace-offering from her father to other monarchs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was well educated, for at a very early age she could read and
      write her own language, as well as French and Spanish. She was sixteen
      when her little brothers were murdered in the Tower, and her love for them
      had been so great that she grieved very deeply over their cruel fate. Her
      engagement with Henry of Richmond, who afterwards ascended the throne,
      turned her attention from this dreadful event somewhat. Elizabeth was
      separated from her mother when they left the sanctuary, and went to the
      court of Richard III., whose queen always treated her with great kindness
      and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Stanley, Henry Tudor's stepfather, occupied a very high position at
      court, and to him the Princess Elizabeth applied for assistance in getting
      possession of the throne, to which she knew she had a right. Stanley had
      several secret interviews with the princess on this subject, and assured
      her that, at his bidding, his adherents in the north-

      would fly to her side, armed and equipped for battle. But, like many of
      the earls of his day, Lord Stanley could not write, and he did not dare
      trust a public scribe with his directions. Thereupon Elizabeth assured him
      that if he would only dictate, and affix his seal, she would do all the
      necessary writing. For this purpose they met in disguise. Six letters were
      duly prepared and sealed, and committed to the care of Humphrey Brereton,
      a knight who had been attached to the cause of Edward IV. These dangerous
      despatches were delivered according to their directions, and on his return
      from the expedition Brereton met Stanley and Elizabeth at an old inn in
      the suburbs of London, with a party of gentlemen who had returned with
      him. This meeting took place at night, and when Elizabeth had satisfied
      herself that no prejudice existed among these men against her Lancastrian
      lover, she agreed to send him a ring through them as a token that he might
      trust himself in Stanley's power. Brereton carried this ring to Henry, who
      was at a monastery some miles from Rennes. The lover kissed his lady's
      present, but kept the messenger waiting three weeks for his answer. Henry
      Tudor had been a fugitive and a prisoner nearly all his life, and extreme
      caution had become second nature to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he consented to undertake an expedition that would either make or
      mar him, and sailed from Harfleur with a large fleet. He was received in
      England with a hearty welcome, for the people regarded him as a saviour
      who was to preserve them from Richard's tyranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1485.</span> On the evening of the 21st of August,
      1485, three weeks after his arrival, Henry encamped with his army near
      Bosworth. The next day the celebrated battle was fought, which terminated
      the life of Richard III., and placed Henry Tudor on the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of Anne of Warwick Richard III. had <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link336" id="link336">336</a></span>sent his niece, Elizabeth, to a
      castle in Yorkshire, where she was kept as a close prisoner, and the first
      intimation she had of her royal lover's success was when the people of the
      neighborhood gathered about the gloomy building with shouts of joy. A
      guard of nobility and gentry escorted her in state to London, and she went
      in company with her mother to live at Westminster Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry VII. was recognized as King of England, and crowned soon after; but
      he seemed in no hurry about his marriage, which did not take place until
      January 18th of the following year. The event was celebrated with
      bonfires, banquets, dancing and songs, and the prelate who performed the
      ceremony held a bunch of red and white roses, tied together for the first
      time. This was in commemoration of the union of the rival houses of York
      and Lancaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1486.</span> The royal couple then went to live at
      Winchester, where in the course of a year their first child was born. He
      was named Arthur, after King Henry's favorite hero and ancestor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1487.</span> The birth of this prince was
      succeeded by his mother's coronation, which took place in November, 1487.
      On the Friday before that important ceremony Elizabeth went with her
      husband from London to Greenwich. She was accompanied on the river Thames
      by a grand pageant of boats, the finest being rowed by the students of
      Lincoln's Inn, who had beautiful music performed on their barge throughout
      the route, and kept side by side with that of the queen. That night was
      passed at the Tower, where the king created eleven Knights of the Bath,
      and the next day Elizabeth proceeded through the city to Westminster
      Palace. An immense crowd collected to behold their queen, as this was her
      first public appearance since her marriage. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link337" id="link337">337</a></span>She was not quite twenty-two;
      her figure was tall and handsome; her complexion fair and brilliant. She
      had, besides, soft blue eyes and delicate features, set off by a profusion
      of yellow hair. Her costume on this occasion was a gown of white silk,
      brocaded with gold, and a mantle of the same material, bordered with
      ermine and fastened across the breast with gold cords and tassels. A
      close-fitting cap, formed of rich gems in a golden network, encircled her
      head, and her hair fell loosely around her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young queen was borne in an open litter, and four of the new Knights
      of the Bath supported a rich canopy over her head. She was preceded by
      four baronesses, riding on gray horses, and Henry's Uncle Jasper, as grand
      steward. Lord Stanley, now Earl of Derby, was high constable, and the Earl
      of Oxford, Lord Chamberlain. The queen was followed by her sister Cicely,
      who sat in an open chariot with the Duchess of Bedford, and a long train
      of other vehicles containing noble ladies, the rear being brought up by
      six baronesses on horseback. The streets were all decorated, and a chorus
      of children, dressed as angels, sang the queen's praises as she passed
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning Elizabeth entered Westminster Hall in a rich robe of
      purple velvet edged with ermine. A coronet of gold, set with large pearls
      and colored gems, encircled her brow. She stood under a canopy of state,
      and then, followed by her attendants, proceeded to the abbey. A strip of
      carpet over which she walked was cut to pieces and distributed among the
      throng assembled to gaze upon her, and so eager were they to possess
      themselves of this memento that several people were trampled to death.
      King Henry and his mother took no part in the coronation, but sat in a
      latticed box placed for their use, and observed both the church ceremony
      and the banquet, at which the queen presided, afterwards. From that time
      she appeared in public with all the splendor of a Queen of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1489.</span> In 1489 a little princess was born;
      she was named Margaret after the king's mother, who presented the infant
      with a silver box filled with gold pieces. At the christening a play was
      performed before the royal family at the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1491.</span> The second prince, who afterwards
      reigned as Henry VIII., was born June 28, 1491. He was always remarkable
      for strength and robust health, but we shall have more to say about him
      hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Elizabeth was so generous, not only to her own family, but to those
      of her subjects who brought her trifling presents of early vegetables,
      fruit, or flowers, that she often found herself in debt, and had to pawn
      her plate or jewels to satisfy her creditors. But her own wants were
      limited, and she managed her personal expenses with economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1495.</span> In 1495 the king and queen were in
      great trouble on account of the invasion of Perkin Warbeck, who was
      married to one of Henry's nearest relatives. This man was an impostor, but
      so active in his movements, appearing in quick succession in various parts
      of the realm, that for seven long years there was danger of his usurping
      the crown. At last, the battle of Blackheath decided his cause; for it was
      won by King Henry, and Perkin was soon after captured. Henry did not wish
      to shed the blood of this kinsman, but it became absolutely necessary
      before peace could be restored. He was therefore hanged at Tyburn,
      November 16, 1499. The Earl of Warwick had allowed himself to become so
      implicated in Perkin's schemes that he too was condemned to death; his
      execution took place on Tower Hill a fortnight later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1499.</span> A dreadful plague broke out in
      England, the same year, and the king felt so alarmed for the safety of his
      family that he took them to Calais, where they resided for a couple of
      months. During that period two marriages of great importance were agreed
      upon. One was between the little Princess Mary, Henry's youngest daughter,
      and Charles, son of the archduke, Philip of Austria; the other was between
      Arthur, Prince of Wales, and Katharine of Arragon, but within five months,
      Prince Arthur was dead. The king and queen were at Greenwich Palace when
      the loss of their eldest son was made known to them. Each tried to comfort
      the other and to bear the sad bereavement with Christian fortitude. But
      Arthur had been a promising youth, and it was long before his afflicted
      mother could reconcile herself to his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following January, 1502, the Princess Margaret was betrothed to James
      VI. of Scotland. The ceremony was performed at St. Paul's Cathedral and
      presided over by the queen, who afterwards led her daughter by the hand to
      a grand banquet prepared at the Bishop of London's Palace Margaret, who
      was only a little over twelve years of age remained in England to finish
      her education under her mother's care.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1503.</span> But on February 11, 1503, the gentle,
      pious, lovely, and dearly-loved Queen Elizabeth expired, suddenly, after a
      very short illness. This event cast a gloom over the whole city; the bells
      of St. Paul's and of all the churches in London tolled dismally, and the
      utmost sorrow was felt in every household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen's body was embalmed and placed within the Tower Chapel where it
      lay in state for twelve days. Then? after mass had been celebrated, it was
      placed in a hearse covered with black velvet, on which was a large white
      cross. An image exactly representing the queen was placed in a chair
      above. This image was decked out with royal robes, crown, sceptre, jewels
      and everything just as Elizabeth had appeared when living. Four women
      kneeled by the chair, on top of the hearse, which was drawn by six horses,
      in black velvet trappings, from the Tower to Westminster.<span

    </h5>
    <p>
      The horses were led by men robed in black; eight ladies of honor rode
      singly after the hearse, followed by the lordmayor, other authorities, and
      a long train of citizens. at every door in the city stood a man bearing a
      lighted torch, and at various points groups of thirty-seven virgins, that
      number corresponding with the queen's age, were stationed, all dressed in
      white and holding lighted tapers. Torches burned before all the churches,
      and bands of monks and nuns, singing anthems, met the funeral procession
      as it moved along. The Earl of Derby led a party of nobles, who preceded
      the hearse into the churchyard of St. Margaret, Westminster. The body was
      carried into the abbey, where it was placed on a dais richly covered with
      velvet drapery, on which the queen's motto: 'humble and reverent,' was
      embroidered. All the lords and ladies in attendance then retired to
      Westminster Palace and took supper. next morning the remains of Elizabeth
      were put in the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry VII. lived seven years after his wife's death, and developed some
      very bad traits when her influence was removed. He had never permitted her
      to have any voice in the government of the realm, but in her gentle loving
      manner she had prompted him to many a generous, sensible action. He died
      in 1509, and was buried in the splendid chapel at Westminster Abbey which
      bears his name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="link341" id="link341">341</a></span>

      CHAPTER XXII. KATHARINE OF ARRAGON, FIRST QUEEN OF HENRY VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1485-1536.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>atharine of
      Arragon was born when her native land was at the very height of its
      prosperity. Her parents were Ferdinand and Isabella, the powerful and
      popular sovereigns, who had conquered nearly the whole of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine's early infancy was passed in a camp where Queen Isabella
      resided with her young family while her army besieged the town of Granada.
      This siege lasted for several years, but the town was taken at last; and
      when Katharine was four years old she accompanied her parents in their
      grand triumphal entry into Granada, where she lived until she went to
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her residence was in the Alhambra, that gorgeous palace, once the abode of
      the Moorish kings, always an object of wonder and admiration, even to this
      very day when it is almost in ruins. Part of her time was passed in the
      cool, shady bowers of the Generalife, the fairy palace which stood on a
      mountain high above the Alhambra, in the midst of luxuriant groves, fruit,
      flowers, arbors and hedges, such as only a southern climate can produce.
      It was from this home that Katharine took her device of the pomegranate,
      which was used during her reign in England as a decoration. This fruit was
      once a production of Granada, and was worked on the coat-of-arms of the
      Moorish kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Isabella was the most learned princess of her time in Europe, and
      knew the importance of a good edu-

      her four daughters. Consequently she provided them with the very best
      tutors she could find, and they early became excellent Latin scholars.
      Katharine read the Scriptures in that tongue, and throughout her whole
      life continued to study it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was sixteen years old Henry VII. of England sent ambassadors to
      Spain to demand her hand in marriage for his son, Prince Arthur. The union
      was agreed upon, and Katharine sailed with four young ladies and other
      attendants for Plymouth, where she was received by a crowd of nobility and
      gentry, who entertained her all the time she was amongst them with a
      variety of sports peculiar to their country. As soon as her arrival was
      known the king sent Lord Brook, steward of the royal palace, to provide
      everything for her comfort. The Duchess of Norfolk and the Earl of Surrey
      went to meet her also, and the former remained as her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following month the king himself set out for Plymouth, but the roads
      were in such a wet, muddy condition that it was several days before he
      reached East Hampstead, where he met Prince Arthur, who did not until then
      know of the arrival of his bride. Next morning they continued their
      journey, but had not gone far when they were met by a party of Spanish
      cavaliers on horseback, who stopped them, and in a most solemn manner
      informed them that they could not proceed further, because their Moorish
      customs forbade the royal bridegroom or his father to look upon the face
      of the bride until she stood at the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Henry was amazed. He was quite willing to observe all reasonable
      forms and ceremonies, but to his English ideas this seemed thoroughly
      absurd, and he was not willing to turn back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to a dead halt in the drenching rain on that cold November
      morning, and felt rather cross at having <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link346" id="link346">346</a></span>his progress thus interrupted.
      After a few moments consideration he called his councillors about him, and
      asked what he should do. A long discussion ensued, and the conclusion was,
      "that the Spanish infanta, being now in the heart of this realm of which
      King Henry was master, he might look at her if he liked." This suited the
      king precisely, and, leaving his son behind, he rode rapidly forward to
      the next town, where Katharine had arrived only a couple of hours before.
      Her retinue were thrown into a terrible state of perplexity when Henry
      made a request to see her, and presented himself for that purpose at the
      very door of her apartments. An archbishop, a bishop, and a count stood
      guard, and informed the king "that the lady infanta had retired to her
      chamber." But the more opposition he met with the more his curiosity was
      aroused, and the more determined was he to see the bride. He declared that
      "if she were even in bed he meant to see and speak with her, for that was
      his mind and the whole intent of his coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing more to be said, and further opposition might have given
      serious offence to the monarch, therefore the infanta dressed herself and
      admitted him. The interview must have been rather unsatisfactory, because
      neither could speak the language of the other; however somebody must have
      interpreted what was said, for King Henry seemed much pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew, to change his damp garments, and within half an hour
      presented himself again at Katharine's door, this time with the prince,
      who had followed him. In the presence of several bishops and nobles the
      young people went through the ceremony of betrothal, which was done in
      Latin, and therefore understood by both. After supper the king and Prince
      Arthur returned to the infanta's apartments, where the evening was passed
      in music and dancing, <span class="pagenum"><a name="link347" id="link347">347</a></span>

      interspersed with singing by the minstrels. Prince Arthur could not join
      in the Spanish dances, but he knew the English ones, and went through the
      figures with one of the ladies of his own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine continued her journey next day, and on her arrival at Kingston
      was met by the Duke of Buckingham on horseback, the Earl of Kent, Lord
      Henry Stafford, the Abbot of Bury, and four hundred dukes and gentlemen,
      in the Stafford livery of scarlet and black, who came to welcome her into
      the realm. She rested at that place all night, and was escorted to
      Kensington Palace next day by Buckingham and his train. There she stopped
      until the Spanish retinue, as well as all the nobility of England, could
      make the necessary preparations for her grand entry to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime King Henry went to meet his wife at Richmond, and to tell
      her what he thought of their new daughter-in-law. The royal couple then
      came down the Thames, in a barge, with a party of ladies to welcome the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later the infanta entered the city by London Bridge, riding on
      a large mule, according to the Spanish custom. The Duke of York rode on
      her right and the pope's ambassador on her left. She had on a broad, round
      hat, the shape of those worn by cardinals, tied down at the sides with a
      scarf of gold lace. Under this hat was a closely-fitting red cap, and her
      long dark hair streamed over her shoulders. Her four Spanish damsels
      followed on mules, each led by an English lady, dressed in cloth of gold
      and riding on a small horse. After these came the whole grand procession,
      and all advanced to Bishop's Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1501.</span> Four days later the marriage ceremony
      was performed at St. Paul's Cathedral, on a platform six feet high and
      large enough to hold eight persons. The were present at the ceremony. The
      king and queen sat in a box that had been built for their use near the
      platform. After the ceremony the bride and bridegroom followed the
      churchmen to the high altar, where mass was celebrated. Standing in the
      great doorway of the cathedral, Prince Arthur endowed his bride with
      one-third of his property. The princess was then led by her
      brother-in-law, young Henry, to the Bishop's Palace of St. Paul's, where a
      banquet was spread. The newly-wedded couple were served <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link350" id="link350">350</a></span>bride, who
      never entirely gave up her Spanish style of dress, wore a closely-fitting
      cap of white silk, from which hung the Spanish mantilla, embroidered with
      gold, pearls and precious stones, that almost concealed her figure. Her
      body and sleeves were made very full, and she wore a large hoop under her
      skirts.

      Prince Arthur was dressed in white satin. The Archbishop of Canterbury and
      nineteen bishops and abbots <span class="pagenum"><a name="link351"

      precious stones, valued at twenty thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following week a grand tournament was held in the open space in front
      of Westminster Hall. There was a stage erected for the royal party. On the
      right entered the king and his lords; on the left, the queen, the bride,
      and their ladies, and took their seats on richly embroidered cushions,
      under a canopy draped with cloth of gold. The places, that were arranged
      one above another, in rows like those in a circus, to form an enormous
      circle, were so packed with people that only their heads could be seen.
      Presently loud blasts from the trumpets announced the arrival of the
      knights, who were borne into the arena under fanciful canopies. The Earl
      of Essex sat in a pavilion among trees, flowers, and rocks, with
      curious-looking animals climbing up the sides. A handsome young lady,
      fantastically dressed, stood on a green hill above the earl. The Marquis
      of Dorset appeared in a pavilion all draped in gold, wearing a complete
      suit of armor. Lord William Courtenay rode an enormous red dragon, led by
      a giant carrying a tree in his hands. There were twenty or thirty in all
      of these curiously-adorned knights, who marched around the arena to the
      delight of the audience, and then engaged in a tilt that caused many a
      bruise and scratch, but no serious damage to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      When evening came on the royal company withdrew to Westminster Hall. At
      the upper end was a dais with elevated seats for the king, queen, the
      bride and groom, and the king's mother. All the ladies sat on the left
      side and the gentlemen on the right, and the nobility, who were not
      engaged in the performance or ballets that followed, took their places on
      the king's side of the hall according to their rank. When a couple desired
      to dance between the entrances of the regular performers, the gentleman
      would <span class="pagenum"><a name="link352" id="link352">352</a></span>advance
      to the front of the dais from his side, the lady would do the same from
      hers, and after a few minutes' dancing return to their respective places.
      The first pageant was a full-rigged ship drawn in on wheels. The mariners
      performed their duties as though they were really at sea, and used only
      seafaring terms. Next came a castle all lighted up inside, eight young
      women appearing at the windows handsomely attired in the newest styles. At
      the top window of the castle sat a lady in Spanish costume representing
      Katharine of Arragon. The princess must have been amused when she saw her
      double, who sat up quite haughtily, while two gentlemen courted her and
      sought in every possible way to gain her favor. For a while she treated
      their attentions with disdain, but at last, as in all ballets, matters
      took a favorable turn; the ladies came out of the castle, were joined by
      the sailors from the ship, and the whole party danced a grand set of
      exceedingly pretty figures, and then disappeared into the castle again.
      This structure was drawn by marvellous gold and silver lions harnessed
      with massive gold chains. But we must explain what these beasts really
      were. In each one were two men, one in the fore and the other in the hind
      quarters, so completely hidden that nothing appeared of them but their
      legs, which were made to look like those of the real lions. Then Prince
      Arthur danced with his aunt, the Princess Cicely, Henry, Duke of York,
      with his sister Margaret, and Katharine with one of her Spanish ladies.
      There was considerable difference in the two styles of dancing, for the
      English movements were quick and lively, while those of the Spanish were
      slow and stately, resembling a minuet. The king and queen were much
      pleased with these performances of their children, and watched them with a
      great deal of pride.

      following Sunday, Katharine distributed the prizes won in the tilt. To the
      Duke of Buckingham she gave a valuable diamond; to the Marquis of Dorset,
      a superb ruby, and to the others, rings set with precious stones. <span

      A week later the court went to Richmond, where, after mass on the first
      Sunday, they all assembled in the gardens and played games of chess,
      backgammon, cards, and dice, while some Spaniards entertained them with
      tumbling and dancing. In the evening a huge rock was drawn by three
      sea-horses into the grand hall, where the ladies and gentlemen were
      assembled. On either side of the rock were mermaids made of shells, and
      inside of the figures were the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link356"
      id="link356">356</a></span>sweet-voiced children who sang in the king's
      chapel. These could not be seen, but their harmony filled the air as the
      rock was drawn slowly through the whole length of the hall. When it
      reached the platform on which sat the royal family, a large number of
      white doves flew out, and live rabbits ran about the hall, causing great
      shouting and merriment. King Henry closed the entertainment by making rich
      gifts of plate to the lords and ladies from Spain, who then took leave of
      their princess, as they were going back home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine looked very sad after they had left her, and the king observing
      this sent word for her and her ladies to join him in his library. There he
      showed them all the pretty English and Latin books that he thought would
      please them, laughed and chatted in a kind friendly manner with his
      daughter-in-law, and then asked her to select some jewels from a lot that
      he had ordered for her. After she had made her choice, he distributed the
      rest among her ladies, and so won Katharine's heart by his warm,
      affectionate treatment that she ceased to feel depressed in her English
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months later the princess went with her husband to Wales, where they
      were to have a little court of their own similar to the one at
      Westminster. Katharine performed the journey on horseback, and when she
      felt fatigued she rested on a litter, borne between two horses. This was
      the only mode of travelling before turnpike roads were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince and Princess of Wales made themselves very popular in their new
      home, but they did not stay there long, for Arthur was taken suddenly ill,
      and died of the plague the following April, 1502, just six months after
      his marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1502.</span> The queen was sorely grieved at the
      sudden death of her eldest child, but she did not forget to sympathize
      with the young widow left alone in a strange land, the language of which
      had hardly become familiar to <span class="pagenum"><a name="link357"
      id="link357">357</a></span>her ear. She sent for her immediately, and had
      her brought to London in a litter covered with black velvet and black
      cloth that must have looked very like a hearse, and settled her in a
      palace called Arragon House, where she spent part of her widowhood. Her
      marriage portion consisted of two hundred thousand crowns. Half the sum
      had been paid, and her parents being unwilling to pay the other half,
      requested that their daughter should be returned to them. But Henry VII.
      wanted to get hold of the other half of his daughter-in-law's portion, he
      therefore proposed a marriage between her and his younger son Henry. This
      was accepted by the sovereigns of Spain, providing a dispensation from the
      pope could be obtained. This was necessary on account of the relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine seems to have been very unhappy at this time, and wrote her
      father that she had no desire to marry again, adding, "that she did not
      wish him to consider her tastes or wishes, but to act in all things as
      suited him best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such dutiful conduct excites our surprise when we consider that she was
      the principal person concerned. It seems quite natural that at the age of
      eighteen she should have objected to a union with a boy five years
      younger, even though he had not been so nearly related to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her objections, two such diplomatists as King Ferdinand
      and Henry VII. were pretty sure to arrange matters to suit themselves, and
      about a year after Katharine became a widow, she was betrothed to the
      young prince. Six years elapsed before the marriage was celebrated, during
      which period Henry VII. died, and his son Henry ascended the throne.
      Immediately after this event he assured the Spanish ambassador of his
      attachment to Katharine, saying that he loved her better than any other
      woman in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of discussion among the church{358]men on account
      of the relationship existing between Henry and Katharine, but at last all
      difficulties were overcome and they were married. A few days later the
      coronation took place at Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1510.</span> On this occasion the streets of
      London were as usual all decorated, and part of the way to the abbey was
      lined with young maidens dressed in pure white, bearing palms of white wax
      in their hands. They were attended by priests swinging silver censers as
      the king and queen passed by. Katharine was attired as a bride in white
      embroidered satin-, her dark hair fell in rich profusion down her back,
      and on her head she wore a crown set with rich jewels. She was seated in a
      litter covered with white cloth of gold, borne by two white horses, and
      was followed by all the noble ladies of England in little chariots. After
      the coronation a grand banquet was spread in Westminster Hall. The king
      and queen were served on an elevated platform at the upper end of the
      hall, while several ladies of high rank sat at Katharine's feet holding
      her pocket-handkerchief, table-napkin, fan and purse. At the end of a week
      the festivities came suddenly to an end on account of the death of the
      king's grandmother. Then a pestilence broke out in London, and the court
      removed to Richmond Place, where Henry planned all sorts of performances,
      parties and masquerades, in which he enjoyed taking part. Katharine did
      not care so much for that kind of diversion, for she was naturally quiet
      and studious, and felt more interested in practical employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one of the Christmas festivals the king slyly left her side during the
      progress of a tournament, and returned in the disguise of a knight,
      astonishing all the company with the grace and skill of his tilting. The
      applause he received induced him to take part often in these exercises,
      and when he would present himself before his wife in different <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link359" id="link359">359</a></span>disguises she
      good-humoredly pretended to be very much mystified. Once he entered her
      room with several nobles dressed as Robin Hood and his men, and another
      time when the foreign ambassadors were invited to dine at court Henry
      conducted his wife to her throne, then suddenly disappeared, and in a few
      minutes returned with the Earl of Essex, both disguised as Turks, while
      other nobles followed him in Russian, Persian and Moorish costumes, the
      last having their faces blacked. The king's beautiful sister, Mary, with
      several of the court ladies, danced a ballet in mask, which amused
      Katharine very much, particularly as the princess was attired like an
      Ethiopian queen. In all the decorations used on these occasions the
      pomegranate was mingled with the roses of York and Lancaster, and the
      Tudor device of the hawthorn with its scarlet berries.

    <p>
      At the close of the year 1510 the queen had a little boy, <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link360" id="link360">360</a></span>and he was
      named Henry. The king was so much pleased at this event that a grand
      tournament was given to celebrate it. In the evening a nobleman came to
      inform the queen that there was a gold arbor full of ladies who had
      prepared something for her entertainment. Katharine answered very
      graciously "that both she and her ladies would be happy to behold them and
      their pastimes." Then a large curtain was drawn aside, and an arbor moved
      forward. It had posts and pillars covered with gold and twined with
      branches of hawthorn, roses and eglantine, all made of satin and silk, the
      colors of the different flowers. In the arbor were six beautiful young
      girls in white and green satin dresses, covered with the letters H. and K.
      knit together with gold lacing. Near the bower stood the king himself,
      with five lords dressed in purple satin, likewise covered with the gold
      letters H. and K. Then they all danced before Katharine, and while they
      were thus engaged a very different scene was going on at the other end of
      the hall. The golden arbor that the ladies left for the dance had been
      rolled back close to where a large crowd of Londoners had gathered to see
      the grand doings at court, as they always did in those days. They began to
      finger the ornaments, and finally to pluck them off until they had
      entirely stripped the bower. The chief steward tried to prevent this
      destruction, but not wishing to disturb the ballet by using violence he
      failed entirely. Meanwhile the king finished his performance, and feeling
      in an excellent humor at its success he called to the women in the crowd
      to come and help themselves to the golden letters from his dress and that
      of his company. Little did he imagine what would be the result of this
      order, for scarcely was it given than the whole assembly rushed forward
      like a mob, and seized not only on him but all his guests, helping
      themselves to every glittering ornament that was in sight <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link361" id="link361">361</a></span>They even
      went so far as to take the jewels of the ladies, and to strip the king of
      most of his fine clothing. One of the gentlemen was left with nothing on
      but his flannels. It was amazing what a clean sweep was made in a few
      minutes of all the finery. At last the guards succeeded in clearing the
      hall without bloodshed, and the king laughing heartily handed his wife to
      the banquet in his own chamber, where the court sat down in their tattered
      condition, treating the whole scramble as a frolic. No doubt the young
      king had received a lesson by which he profited later. A few weeks after
      his birth the young prince died, much lamented by everybody at court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following year Henry invaded France in person, leaving the queen not
      only with the reins of government in her own hands, but making her besides
      captain of all his forces, with the assistance of five nobles. During the
      king's absence the Scots invaded his kingdom, but were repulsed. It is
      remarkable that two of the greatest victories gained over that nation were
      those of Neville's Cross and Flodden Field, both fought under the
      management of queens in the absence of their husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the battle at Neville's Cross Katharine went on a pilgrimage to
      Walsingham shrine, and returned just in time to welcome her husband, who
      took her by surprise at Richmond, where there was a most loving meeting
      between the royal couple. He had travelled through his realm in disguise,
      therefore the queen had not been informed that he was coming so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1514.</span> Henry had been victorious in France,
      and the war ended there by the marriage of his beautiful young sister Mary
      and Louis XII. Anne Boleyn, who was then a young girl, went with the bride
      as her attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was in love with the Duke of Suffolk when she was forced into this
      marriage with the King of France. In less <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link362" id="link362">362</a></span>than three months the young
      husband died, and then the duke, who was sent to France to take care of
      the widow and her property, married her. Henry VIII. was very angry at
      first at the sly way in which this love-affair had been managed, but
      Katharine made peace between the brother and sister, and invited the young
      couple to Greenwich Palace, where she entertained them with a grand
      festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first of May the king gave a party, which was conducted in this
      way: Katharine, with the young bride and all the court ladies, rode from
      the palace to Shooter's Hill, where the king, with the archers of his
      body-guard, met them, dressed like Robin Hood and his outlaws, and begged
      that the royal party "would enter the good greenwood and see how outlaws
      lived."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine graciously consented, and was led to a rustic bower, covered
      with hawthorn boughs and spring flowers, where a fine breakfast of venison
      and other good things was laid out. This lodge in the wilderness delighted
      all the ladies, and a couple of hours were very pleasantly passed in
      eating and chatting. On their return to Greenwich they were met by a car,
      all decorated with natural flowers and ribbons, and drawn by five horses.
      Each horse was ridden by a fair damsel, dressed in gay colors, and in the
      car, amidst garlands of flowers, stood lady May, attended by the goddess
      Flora. As soon as the queen appeared at the foot of the hill these young
      girls began a hymn about the return of spring, and preceded the royal
      party all the way home, singing as they moved along.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1520.</span> Queen Katharine had two royal
      visitors at her palace. One was Queen Margaret, widow of James IV. of
      Scotland, who took refuge with Henry VIII. from the troubles in her own
      country; the other was her nephew, who afterwards became so illustrious as
      the Emperor <span class="pagenum"><a name="link363" id="link363">363</a></span>

      V. The latter spent several days with his aunt, who entertained him
      royally, then proceeded with the English Court to that congress with the
      King and Queen of France known on account of its splendor as the Field of
      the Cloth of Gold. At that meeting the carpet beneath Katharine's throne
      was all embroidered in pearls, and the decorations of the camp were of
      corresponding magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time Katharine formed a warm friendship for Queen Claude of
      France, surnamed the Good, a lady of superior intellect and taste. Henry
      and King Francis also became very much attached to each other, though that
      did not prevent their fighting when an opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Charles V. parted from his Aunt Katharine she presented him with a
      beautiful English horse, and a saddlecloth, of gold tissue, bordered with
      precious stones. On his return home, he often spoke of Katharine's
      happiness in having married so grand a prince as Henry VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Queen Katharine was in power several improvements were made in
      England, particularly in the cultivation of fruit and flowers. During the
      wars some of the finest trees had disappeared entirely, but Katharine had
      them replanted, as well as salad, cabbage and carrots, which she imported
      for that purpose from the Holland.
    </p>

      An old rhyme says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

      "Hops and turkeys, carps and beer,

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot help wondering why hops were cultivated, because Henry VIII.,
      who interfered in all the most trifling concerns of his subjects, forbade
      them to put hops in their ale. The turkeys were brought from North America
      by a lieutenant in Sebastian Cabot's voyage of discovery.

    <p>
      Before giving an account of Katharine's wrongs and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link366" id="link366">366</a></span>sufferings, which began after
      she had been married about ten years, let us see how both she and King
      Henry VIII. are described by people who lived in their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastiano Giustiniani, an Italian who lived in England, says, writing in
      1519:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "His majesty is about twenty-nine years of age, as handsome as nature
      could form him,&mdash;handsomer by far than the King of France. He is
      exceedingly fair, and as well-proportioned as possible. When he heard that
      the King of France wore a beard he allowed his to grow also, which, being
      somewhat red, has the appearance of being of gold. He is an excellent
      musician and composer, an admirable horseman and wrestler. He possesses a
      good knowledge of the French, Latin, and Spanish languages, and is very
      devout. On the days when he goes hunting he hears mass three times, but on
      other days as often as five times. He has vesper service every day in the
      queen's chamber. He is uncommonly fond of the chase, and every time he
      attends one he tires out eight or ten horses, stationed at different
      places where he proposes to stop. When one is fatigued he mounts another,
      and by the time he returns home they are all used up. He takes great
      delight in bowling, and it is the pleasantest sight in the world to see
      him engaged in this exercise with his fair skin covered with a beautifully
      fine shirt. Affable and benign, he offends none, and has often said to his
      ambassadors that he wished every one were as content with his condition as
      he was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine was then about thirty-four, but looked no older than her
      husband, because he was a robust, burly man, while she had a slender,
      stately figure. Her face was oval, features regular, with a sweet, calm
      look, though rather heavy. Her forehead was unusually high, and she had
      large, dark eyes, and a bright brunette complexion. She usually wore a
      five-cornered cap, bordered with rich gems, that stood up <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link367" id="link367">367</a></span>around her
      head like a crown, and came down the sides of her face, covering the ears.
      From this cap hung the black Spanish mantilla, and around her throat,
      waist and wrists were clusters of rubies, linked together with strings of
      pearls, pendants of the same from the belt, reaching almost to her feet.
      In one of her portraits she is represented in a robe of dark-blue velvet,
      with a long train, bordered with sable fur, straight sleeves, with ruffles
      around the hand, loose hanging sleeves over them, and a petticoat of
      gold-colored satin, that shows beneath the velvet dress, raised on one
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine was very pious, self-denying, and almost a nun in her
      performance of religious duties. She would rise at different times of the
      night for prayers, and always dressed for the day at five o'clock in the
      morning. She wore the habit of the St. Francis order of nuns beneath her
      royal robes, and unlike the ladies of the present day, she was often heard
      to say that she considered no part of her time so much wasted as that
      passed in dressing and adorning herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fasted on Fridays and Saturdays and on all the saints' days, confessed
      every week, and received the Eucharist every Sunday. For two hours after
      dinner one of her attendants read books on religion to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this devotion Katharine enjoyed lively conversation, and
      often invited Sir Thomas More, whose society gave her great pleasure, to
      her private suppers with the king. She was fond of needle-work also, and
      left some rich specimens of her skill, that were for a long time preserved
      in the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she took great interest in all English customs, and tried to make
      her subjects forget that she was a foreigner, she never could fancy
      field-sports, though Henry expressed great displeasure because she would
      not mount.<span class="pagenum"><a name="link368" id="link368">368</a></span>

      Cardinal Wolsey occupied a prominent position in England at this time, and
      he was a very good friend to Katharine until she felt compelled to express
      her opinion of a certain bad action of his, which was brought about in
      this way: One day the Duke of Buckingham was holding the basin for the
      king to wash his hands when the cardinal poked his in also. The duke
      became very indignant at such presumption, for he considered it beneath
      his dignity to perform such an office for anybody but his sovereign; he
      therefore flung the water all over the cardinal's feet, whereupon that
      worthy prelate scowled revengefully, and angrily a horse and hunt as
      Englishwomen did. For his sake she pretended to like games, though she
      really had little taste in that direction. Even after her misfortunes
      began, the great Erasmus said to Henry: "Your noble wife spends the time
      reading the sacred volume which other princesses occupy with cards and
      dice." That renowned scholar always held her up as an example to her sex,
      and dedicated a very important work to her, called "Christian Matrimony."
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link369" id="link369">369</a></span>threatened
      punishment. He carried it into effect, and succeeded in causing the
      execution of the duke on a charge of treasonable sorcery.

      Buckingham had been one of Katharine's earliest friends in England, and
      she could not help remonstrating against the injustice of his sentence.
      She even pleaded for him with the king, but failed. Wolsey's opposition
      was too strong, so Katharine revenged herself by openly censuring his
      cruel conduct, for which he never forgave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year Charles V. visited his aunt again at Greenwich Palace. He
      came really for the purpose of urging the king to make war against France,
      though he pretended that it was to engage himself to his little cousin,
      Princess Mary, then only six years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Katharine met him at the hall-door, with her daughter by her side,
      and blessed him as he kneeled down before her. He stayed in England six
      weeks, and the result of his visit was more fighting in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Anne Boleyn returned home, and was appointed maid of honor to Queen
      Katharine. She was a great beauty, and such a belle at court that
      unhappily Henry fell in love with her. But he did not make his feelings
      known just then because the queen's health was very bad, and no doubt he
      flattered himself that she might accommodate him by dying, and thus spare
      him the trouble of a divorce. However she grew better, and then, with
      Wolsey's assistance, Henry began to make plans for ridding himself of her.
      His first step was to complain to his confessor that his conscience
      troubled him for having married his brother's widow, but it seems strange
      that that inward monitor had been silent for so many years. He set spies
      to watch Katharine's actions, hoping, no doubt, that something might be
      discovered to help his cause; but he was disappointed, and the queen was
      secretly informed of his intentions. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link370" id="link370">370</a></span>Naturally she was very
      indignant, and wanted to consult her nephew, Charles V., as to what she
      ought to do. For that purpose she sent a faithful servant, but he was
      stopped on the way by one of Wolsey's agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then expressed her intention of going to law about the matter, and
      consulted her confessor, hoping that it would be laid before the church.
      The poor, friendless woman might have known that she could scarcely look
      for justice in a land not her own against a popular sovereign and his
      all-powerful adviser. She had an interview with her husband, but he put
      her off with deceitful excuses and fair promises, and she was forced to
      await patiently whatever his pleasure might prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime a pestilence broke out in London, and several of the royal
      household died of it. This so alarmed Henry that he made thirty-nine
      wills, confessed his sins every day, and passed most of his time in
      penitence and prayer, his only recreation being the mixing of medicines
      and the compounding of plasters and ointments. He even sent Anne Boleyn
      home to her relations. But no sooner did the pestilence disappear than his
      jovial spirits returned, and he began to write daily love-letters to his
      favorite. Wolsey, to aid the king's divorce, had made the pope believe
      that Katharine wished to retire from the world and lead a religious life,
      and it is possible that he thought she might be persuaded to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1528.</span> She did not know of this deception
      until Campeggio, the pope's legate, arrived in England in 1528. Then, in
      order to disprove it, she adopted a different course of conduct, became
      gay and lively, and encouraged all sorts of diversions among her court
      ladies. She tried to make herself popular with her subjects too, by being
      more gracious than before, and appearing oftener in public. This behavior
      was turned against her by the king's council, t <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link371" id="link371">371</a></span>who were told that the queen was
      only gay because her husband was sad, and that she was conspiring for his
      death and that of his cardinal. Thereupon they advised Henry to separate
      himself from her entirely, and to remove the Princess Mary from her
      guardianship. This piece of malice was a sting bitterer than death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine knew that Wolsey was her chief persecutor, and did not hesitate
      to charge him with all her troubles as well as with being an enemy to her
      nephew, Charles V.
    </p>
    <p>
      That emperor was very much distressed when he heard of the turn affairs
      had taken, and declared that if the pope decided against his aunt he would
      not complain, but if not, he would support her and her daughter as far as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, 1529, there was a solemn court held in the great hall of the
      palace at Blackfriars, Wolsey and Campeggio presiding. Each of the
      prelates was seated in a large chair, covered with rich tapestry, near a
      long table. On the right was a canopy with a massive chair for the king,
      and on the left a similar one for the queen. Henry did not appear at
      first, but Katharine entered the hall, attended by four bishops and a
      train of court ladies, to say that she would only accept the decision of
      the pope, because the cardinals who were present were too prejudiced to be
      just. She then left.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several weeks of discussion the king and queen were both summoned to
      appear in court. When the crier called: "Henry, King of England, come into
      court," he answered distinctly, and standing up beneath his canopy, spoke
      of the virtues of his wife and of his unwillingness to part from her,
      excepting to soothe the pangs of his conscience. Then Katharine was
      called. She was already present, seated in her chair, and merely rose to
      explain that the action of the court was illegal, stating reasons why such
      was the case. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link372" id="link372">372</a></span>Her
      name was called again. Then she rose a second time, and walked around the
      table the whole length of the court, until she came to where the king sat.
      Kneeling down before him, she made a most touching appeal, begging him to
      take compassion on her, a stranger in his land, and let her have some
      justice. She also requested him to suspend the trial until she could hear
      from her family in Spain and get their advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had finished her long address to the king, she made a low bow,
      and with a dignified air slowly marched out of court. As she moved away,
      her name was called several times, whereupon the person on whose arm she
      leaned said: "Madam, you are called back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear it well enough," she replied; "but on&mdash;on&mdash;go you on,
      for this is no court wherein I can have justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her appeal to the king had made such an impression on all present that he
      made a long speech, lamenting "that his conscience should urge the divorce
      of such a queen who had ever been a devoted wife, full of gentleness and
      virtue." The members of his council knew well that he was not speaking the
      truth, but they did not dare to tell him so. As Cardinal Wolsey was still
      a favorite, the king closed his harangue by an assurance that he was in no
      way to blame for the desired divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later Katharine was summoned to court again, but refused to obey,
      and with her own hand wrote an appeal to the pope. The cardinals had done
      all they could think of to get the queen to consent to a divorce, and
      being at a loss how to proceed, they took a vacation of three months. At
      the expiration of that term the two cardinals went to Bridewell, and
      requested a private interview with Katharine. She received them
      courteously, impressed upon them her forlorn situation in a foreign land,
      deprived of counsel, and told them that she would be <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link373" id="link373">373</a></span>grateful if they would advise
      her how to act. She then withdrew with them to a private room, where they
      remained for nearly an hour in earnest conversation. She must have argued
      her case well, for both the cardinals were won over to her side, and would
      never say another word against her. This was the only cause for offence
      that King Henry ever had against Wolsey, who ceased, from that moment, to
      be his favorite.

    <p>
      When the court met again, the king was very angry to hear that the
      question of his divorce must be referred to the pope. He wanted it settled
      in his way and in England. Shortly after, Wolsey had an interview with the
      king, which proved his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king and queen passed Christmas together at Greenwich with the usual
      festivities, and seemed to be on very good terms, he treating the Princess
      Mary very tenderly, and showing Katharine the respect due the Queen of
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had an object in this; he wanted his wife to withdraw her appeal
      from Rome, and let the matter be decided <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link374" id="link374">374</a></span>in England, but she refused.
      Then he got angry, put a sudden stop to the court diversions, and retired
      to the palace at Whitehall that he had just taken from Wolsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, he sent a message to the queen entreating her to "quiet his
      conscience." She replied: "God grant my husband a quiet conscience; but I
      mean to abide by no decision excepting that of Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer put the king in a perfect fury. After the festival of Trinity
      he accompanied the queen to Windsor, but left in a few days, and sent her
      word to be out of the castle before his return. "Go where I may," was the
      reply of the forsaken queen, "I am his wife, and for him I will pray!" She
      immediately left Windsor Castle, and never again beheld her husband or
      child. She went to reside at Ampthill, whence she wrote her daughter
      letters full of most excellent advice, always praying her to submit to her
      father's will. Her reason for this was that she wished the child to keep
      in the king's good graces, knowing that he would some time or other
      acknowledge her rights. Once, on hearing of Mary's illness, Katharine
      wrote to Cromwell for permission to see her, but was cruelly refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding at last that the decision at Rome was likely to be against him,
      the king induced Dr. Cranmer, who had just been made Archbishop of
      Canterbury, to conclude the long agitated question of the divorce by
      granting it. At the commencement of the following year he married Anne
      Boleyn, and there were insurrections raised in many parts of the kingdom
      on account of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Queen Katharine not been such a good woman she might have given the
      king a great deal of trouble by heading a party against him, particularly
      as the House of Commons had requested him to take her back. At the end of
      several months Cranmer succeeded in getting the divorce <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link375" id="link375">375</a></span>settled; but
      the sorrow and anxiety that poor Katharine had suffered had broken down
      her health, so that when Lord Montjoy went to inform her that she was no
      longer Queen of England, but dowager Princess of Wales, he found her very
      ill in bed. She declared that she had been crowned and anointed queen, and
      would be called by that title as long as she lived, and no bribes or
      threats would move her in the least. She forbade her servants to take an
      oath to serve her as Princess of Wales, and many of them were obliged to
      quit her service because they would not disobey her. Those who remained
      were excused from taking the oath at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine always judged her rival in the most charitable light, and seemed
      to think her an object of pity. Once when one of her women cursed Anne
      Boleyn, because she saw how troubled her mistress was, Katharine said:
      "Hold your peace! curse her not, but rather pray for her, for even now is
      the time fast coming when you shall have reason to pity her and lament her
      case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine had removed to Buckden, where she passed her time in praying and
      deeds of charity, or embroidering for the churches. After a while she
      regained her peace of mind, and made herself greatly beloved by the
      country people, who visited her frequently, and showed her the deepest
      respect. Other messengers were sent to her from Henry, requesting her to
      call herself Prince Arthur's widow, and to resign the title of queen. This
      made her very angry, and she declared that she was the king's wife, not
      his subject, and would be called queen until she died. She was the only
      person in the realm who dared to defy the king; she had lost his love, but
      not his esteem. Anybody at court who was known to speak in Katharine's
      favor was either locked up in the Tower or executed, and a perfect reign
      of terror was the result. When she heard <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link376" id="link376">376</a></span>how her friends had suffered on
      her account her health grew worse, and as she was anxious to live for the
      sake of her daughter she sent a request to the king to appoint her a
      residence nearer London. He named Fotheringay Castle, a place that was
      notoriously unhealthy. But Katharine absolutely refused to go there, and
      after a great deal of opposition on the part of the king's agents she was
      removed to Kimbolton Castle, deprived of many comforts that her ill-health
      made necessary for her. One serious cause of distress to Katharine was the
      imprisonment of her two confessors, who, simply because they took sides
      with her, were subjected to the most cruel torments.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1536.</span> By the end of the year the queen was
      on her death-bed. When she knew her end was approaching she sent an
      entreaty to Henry that she might be permitted to see her child and give
      her a blessing. It was refused. A few days before she expired Katharine
      called one of her maids to her bedside and, dictated a farewell letter to
      the king, in which she pardons him for all the misery he has caused her,
      and prays that God may also pardon him. She commends their daughter Mary
      to his care, and begs him to be a good father to her. And in conclusion
      she requests marriage portions for her three maids, and a year's extra pay
      for all her other servants lest they should be unprovided for. Henry shed
      tears on reading the letter, and sent Eustachio, the Spanish ambassador,
      to attend Katharine's death-bed. He and Lady Willoughby, the friend and
      countrywoman of the queen, who hastened to her at the last, were the only
      persons present when she passed away. In her will she left a few legacies,
      but her income had been so cut down during the last few years of her
      existence that she had not much to dispose of. She mentions her dresses
      that Henry kept when she was so brutally turned away from his palace, and
      begs that they be used for church <span class="pagenum"><a name="link377"
      id="link377">377</a></span>ornaments. She was buried at Peterborough
      Abbey, and for several years a canopy covered with a black velvet cloth,
      on which was embroidered a large silver cross and the Spanish
      coat-of-arms, stood over the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had a solemn service at Greenwich on the day of Katharine's burial,
      at which he appeared with his attendants in deep mourning, and commanded
      all his court to do the same. Anne Boleyn dressed herself and all her
      ladies in yellow instead, and heartlessly laughed over the death of the
      queen. "I am grieved," she said, "not because she is dead, but for the
      vaunting of the good end she made." She had reason to speak so, for
      nothing was talked of but the Christian death-bed of Katharine, and many
      books and papers were written in her praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after her burial some of her friends ventured to suggest to
      the king that a monument ought to be erected to her memory. He answered:
      "That he would have to her memory one of the goodliest monuments in
      Christendom." This was the beautiful abbey church of Peterborough, for
      when Henry VIII. caused the destruction of all the convents and
      monasteries in England he spared that one because it contained Queen
      Katharine's remains. Through all her bitter trials no enemy was successful
      in tarnishing Katharine of Arragon's good name, but Shakspeare is the only
      writer who has properly appreciated her moral worth.

      CHAPTER XXIII. ANNE BOLEYN, SECOND QUEEN OF HENRY VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1501-1536.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nne Boleyn was one
      of the beauties of the court of Katharine of Arragon, and was particularly
      attractive to the king on account of her wit and her fondness for pageants
      and masquerades, in which she took a leading part. Henry performed at
      these entertainments, also; thus these two were often thrown together, and
      the lady's vanity and ambition were flattered by the attentions he paid
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an Englishwoman by birth, though of French descent on her father's
      side. Her mother died when she was only eleven years old, and she was
      taken charge of by a French governess called Simonette. She was carefully
      educated, and excelled in music and needlework. Besides, she wrote both
      French and English letters to her father when he was away, and that was an
      accomplishment very rare among ladies of the reign of Henry VIII. {[A. D.
      1514.]} It was probably on account of her superior knowledge that she was
      selected to go with the young Princess Mary to France when she married
      Louis XII., and her knowledge of the language must have been of great
      service to the young girl, who could speak only English. They had a very
      stormy voyage to Boulogne, and had to go ashore in little boats at the
      risk of their lives. It was rather trying to the Princess Mary and her
      four maids of honor to have to appear in their drenched garments before
      all the French nobles who had assembled on the beach to receive them.

      they soon had a chance of showing off their beauty to advantage, for when
      within four miles of Abbeville they mounted white horses, and with thirty
      other ladies who joined the procession, rode into the town. Mary wore a
      superb embroidered robe, and her ladies' dresses were of crimson velvet,
      which must have been particularly becoming to the warm, brunette
      complexion and sparkling black eyes of Anne Boleyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King of France died, and Mary went back to England, Anne did not
      accompany her, but entered the service of Queen Claude, wife of Francis I.
    </p>
    <p>
      This queen was a most excellent woman, and exercised a wholesome influence
      over her maids of honor. They went regularly with her to mass, attended
      her when she appeared in public, and spent part of every day in her
      society reading, embroidering, and weaving. The strict rules of this
      sober-minded queen were rather irksome to the lively English maid of
      honor, for she was fond of all sorts of games, music, and dancing, and is
      said to have invented many new figures and steps which she performed with
      much grace and agility. Another of her gifts was a remarkably sweet voice,
      both in singing and speaking. While at the French court her costume was a
      cap of velvet, trimmed in points, a little gold bell hanging from each
      point; a vest of the same material with silver stars, a jacket of watered
      silk with large hanging sleeves that almost concealed her hands, and a
      skirt to match. Her feet were encased in blue velvet slippers, with a
      strap across the instep, fastened with a diamond star. Her hair fell in
      ringlets about her shoulders. Of course she dressed in this manner only
      when she was very young; later, when she lived in England, her costumes
      were very different. She had one serious defect which, however, she
      managed to conceal with her long sleeves. It was a deformity of the little
      finger of the left hand which some chroniclers say was divided and formed
      two fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1522.</span> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link382" id="link382">382</a></span>She was about twenty years old
      when she returned to England and attached herself to the household of
      Katharine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maids of honor dined at mess in those days like officers of the army
      or navy of the present time, and were plentifully served with all the good
      food the markets afforded, besides an ample supply of ale and wine. Each
      maid of honor was allowed a servant and a spaniel, and those who were
      daughters of peers could have stabling for horses and carriages besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a young man at court named Lord Henry Percy, the eldest son of
      the Duke of Northumberland, whose duty it was to attend Cardinal Wolsey to
      the palace daily; but while that prelate held council with the king, Lord
      Henry would pass the time with the court ladies. The result of these
      visits was a love affair between him and the fair Anne Boleyn. But the
      king had made up his mind to marry the young maid of honor himself as soon
      as he could get a divorce from his wife, consequently he complained to the
      cardinal, and told him that he must break off the match at once, because
      he had planned a marriage for Anne with another person. The cardinal sent
      for Percy and took him to task for thinking to unite himself to anybody
      without first consulting his father and the king. The young man expressed
      his regret at having displeased the king, but declared that he could not
      give up his lady-love. Thereupon Wolsey swore that he should be forced to
      do so, adding: "I will send for your father out of the North, and he and
      we shall take this matter in hand; in the meantime I charge thee to go no
      more into her company to arouse the king's indignation." With these words
      he arose and went into his own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the king's summons the Earl of Northumberland did appear with
      as little delay as possible. He was <span class="pagenum"><a name="link383"
      id="link383">383</a></span>an extremely proud, cold, narrow-minded man,
      who wanted his son to marry a woman at least his equal in rank and wealth;
      therefore at the conclusion of his secret interview with the cardinal he
      rated Percy soundly, and applied to him the most abusive and insulting
      names he could think of. He finished his long lecture by telling him that
      he did not mean to make him his heir, because he had other boys who, he
      trusted, would prove wiser men, and he would choose one of them for his
      successor.

      Percy was then banished from court, and forced to marry Mary Talbot, a
      daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury, with whom he was very unhappy. If only
      he had been strong enough to hold out in his love for Anne a little while
      longer he might have been spared a great deal of misery, for his father
      died in less than three years after his forced marriage, and he became
      Earl of Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      To punish Anne for loving Percy, the king banished her from court and sent
      her home to her father's house. She laid the whole blame on Wolsey, and
      was so angry with him as to declare she would be revenged on him. He could
      never gain favor with her after that. She lived at Hever Castle, with her
      father and stepmother, and was very unhappy on account of the great
      disappointment she had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time the king made an unexpected visit at the castle, but Anne
      pretended to be ill, and would not leave her room all the time he was
      there. But the tyrant was bound to have everything to suit himself, so he
      began to draw her family to court by giving them important offices, and
      advanced her father to the peerage under the title of Viscount Rochford.
      Still Anne did not return, and the king wrote her several letters urging
      her to do so. She dared not show him how angry she was because he had
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link384" id="link384">384</a></span>broken
      off her engagement with Percy, but she was treasuring up a store of
      vengeance against the cardinal, who had been his tool, that she hoped some
      day to visit upon his head. She had been away from court just four years
      when she returned, and Wolsey's enemies were glad to be able to count on
      her influence to crush him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after he was sent on an embassy to France, and it was during
      his absence that Anne gained a great deal of influence over the king.
      Ambition had entered her head, and seeing that Henry admired her, she
      determined to share his throne as soon as his wife could be got out of the
      way. He had asked her to marry him, and only awaited the settlement of the
      divorce, which was a long and tedious affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Boleyn was soon living in Suffolk House, which the king had secured
      for her, and there she had a regular court of her own, with her
      ladies-in-waiting, her train-bearer, and her chaplains, quite independent
      of the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first introduction of Tindal's translation of the Scriptures was made
      while Anne was so powerful. Among her ladies was one called Mistress
      Gaynsford, who had a lover, also employed at Suffolk House, named George
      Zouch. One day the young lady was deeply interested in a book, from which
      she would not raise her eyes, even to speak to George, who tried several
      times to make her listen to him, At last he became very angry and snatched
      the book out of her hand. It proved to be the translation of Tindal, that
      had been privately presented by one of the Reformers to Anne Boleyn. Now,
      this work had been proscribed by Cardinal Wolsey, who was not in favor of
      any reforms in religion, and kept secret from the king. Mistress Gaynsford
      knew this perfectly well, and was so frightened at being discovered with
      it that she begged and implored her lover to return it to her, but merely
      to tease her,

      off with it. The next time he went to the King's chapel, with the other
      courtiers, he took it into his head to read the identical book he had
      taken from his ladylove, and became so absorbed in it that the service was
      concluded without his knowing it. The dean of the chapel wondered what
      George could be reading with so much interest, and asked to have a look at
      the volume. As soon as he saw what it was he carried it to Cardinal
      Wolsey. Meantime, Anne had asked for it, and when she heard into whose
      hands it had fallen, she said: "Well, it shall be the dearest book that
      ever dean or cardinal detained." Then she went to the king, and not only
      succeeded in persuading him to get the book back for her, but made him
      read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This beautiful favorite continued to hate Cardinal Wolsey more and more,
      and was determined that Henry should show him no favors if she could help
      it. Her mind was constantly busy laying plans to keep them apart, and to
      put the cardinal in an unfavorable light, though she used the most
      flattering terms both in speaking and writing to him. This deception she
      continued until he was won over to Queen Katharine's cause, when she
      declared her hostility openly, and she was a woman who would stop at
      nothing that would gratify her thirst for revenge. She was constantly
      poisoning the king's mind against him, yet the old friendship would crop
      out from time to time, and when the cardinal was seized with the
      pestilence Dr. Butts, the king's physician, was sent to attend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen yonder man?" asked King Henry of the doctor. "Yes," was the
      reply; "and if you will have him dead, I warrant you that if he receive
      not some comfort from you he will be dead within four days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid!" cried the king, "I would not lose him for twenty thousand
      pounds. I pray you go to him, and do you care for him." <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link388" id="link388">388</a></span>"Then must
      your grace send him some comfortable message," said Dr. Butts.

    <p>
      "Tell him that I am not offended with him in my heart for anything, and
      bid him be of good comfort," returned the king, handing the doctor a ruby
      ring with his own image carved thereon, and requesting him to carry it to
      the patient. He desired Anne Boleyn to send some token of regard also, and
      she handed the doctor a gold tablet that hung at her side, adding a loving
      message, of which she did not mean a word. Wolsey raised himself in his
      bed when the presents were shown to him, and thanked the doctor joyfully
      for the comfort he had brought. At the end of four days he was well again.
      But he was too near the court for the comfort or ease of his enemies, so
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link389" id="link389">389</a></span>the
      Duke of Norfolk, Anne's uncle, sent him word through Cromwell "that if he
      did not instantly depart for the north he would tear him with his teeth."
      He did go as far as Cawood, near York, but Anne never ceased her
      persecutions until she had him arrested for high treason, and employed her
      early lover Percy to carry him the warrant. No doubt this was done to
      remind the cardinal of her first cause of hatred towards him. He was in
      prison only twenty-five days when he obtained his release.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the Duke of Norfolk, Anne's uncle, was president of the
      cabinet, while the Duke of Suffolk, her father, Sir Thomas More,
      Fitzwilliam, and Stephen Gardiner conducted the affairs of the realm, but
      she was the ruling power that influenced them all. She kept up her court
      with great splendor, and spent money most extravagantly. Still she could
      not marry the king until Cromwell's bold stroke that separated England
      from the power of the pope enabled her to do so.

    <p>
      Then poor Queen Katharine was driven away from Windsor Castle, and the
      king created Anne Boleyn Marchioness of Pembroke, with a pension of £1000
      per annum. This ceremony was performed with great pomp. The king was
      seated on his throne in the presence chamber at Windsor, surrounded by his
      councillors and a number of peers. Anne Boleyn entered, followed by a long
      train of courtiers, and lords and ladies of the nobility. Lady Mary
      carried on her left arm a robe of state made of crimson velvet, lined and
      trimmed with ermine, and in her right hand a coronet of gold. Anne wore a
      jacket of red velvet with short sleeves, her hair hanging loosely about
      her shoulders. She courtesied three times before reaching the throne, then
      kneeled down at the king's feet. After that the charter was read aloud,
      and the king himself placed the mantle on the shoulders of the new
      marchioness and <span class="pagenum"><a name="link390" id="link390">390</a></span>the
      coronet on her head. She thanked the sovereign humbly, and withdrew amidst
      the sounding of trumpets. Anne Boleyn's tastes were much more in harmony
      with those of the king than Katharine's had been, for she was fond of
      hunting and all games of cards and dice. She was a lucky gamester as a
      rule, but Henry's losses were perfectly enormous, and formed quite an
      important item in his private expenses.

      The exact time or place of the marriage between Henry VIII. and Anne
      Boleyn is not known. It was kept secret because it was so unpopular in
      England, but as soon as the ceremony was performed Viscount Rochford was
      sent to France to announce the event to Francis I. When the secret leaked
      out Cranmer publicly announced King Henry's divorce from Queen Katharine
      and his marriage to Anne Boleyn, who then began to appear in state.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1534.</span> Early in May, 1534, the king notified
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link391" id="link391">391</a></span>lord-mayor
      that the coronation of Queen Anne would take place at Westminster on
      Whitsunday, and requested him to conduct her grace from Greenwich to the
      Tower by water a few days before. On the 19th of May the river Thames
      presented a most festive appearance. In obedience to the royal order a
      barge had been decorated and fitted up for Anne Boleyn's use in a most
      gorgeous style. The lord-mayor embarked in this, and fifty others followed
      in his train, one carrying a band of music, while the others were filled
      with all the great men of London dressed in scarlet, many of them wearing
      heavy gold chains about their necks, and others their order of knighthood.
      Hundreds of little row-boats were moving about on the water besides, for
      every one who could procure any sort of a tug accompanied the chief of the
      city to Greenwich, or rested on their oars in the best positions they
      could find to get a sight of the new queen. On the deck of the royal barge
      was a tremendous dragon, surrounded by other monsters that were from time
      to time made to vomit forth fire by concealed artillerymen to the delight
      and terror of the different boats that floated near. On one barge sat a
      score of young ladies amidst festoons of red and white roses arranged on
      branches that formed a canopy, at the summit of which sat a white falcon
      crowned, holding a sceptre in one foot, and Anne Boleyn's motto "Me and
      Mine" hanging on his breast. These young ladies sang the queen's praises
      in a chorus as they glided over the water. All the barges were fitted up
      with gay flags, flowers and banners. Having reached Greenwich Palace they
      anchored, the band performing different pieces of music, and the chorus of
      ladies singing until three o'clock, when Anne appeared superbly dressed
      and attended by her ladies. She entered her barge, and the gay flotilla
      moved down the river again amidst music, cheering, and the sounding of
      trumpets until <span class="pagenum"><a name="link392" id="link392">392</a></span>it
      reached the Tower, when a marvellous peal of guns was shot off. The
      lord-chamberlain received the queen and conducted her to the king, who
      kissed her tenderly. The whole evening the barges hovered near the Tower,
      and from them was a display of brilliant fireworks, while crowds of
      people, stood to witness them on the neighboring wharves and bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      How different were the feelings of the fair Anne within that self-same
      fortress only two short years later. On the eve of the coronation,
      according to the usual custom, the queen was conducted through the city of
      London in grand procession. All the streets through which she passed were
      decorated. The lord-mayor received her at the Tower gate. He wore a
      crimson velvet gown with a gold collar. First in the procession came the
      French ambassador with his retinue in blue and yellow velvet, then the
      judges, next the newly-made Knights of the Bath in violet gowns with hoods
      lined and trimmed with white fur. After them came the abbots, then the
      nobility and the bishops. The Archbishop of York rode with the ambassador
      of Venice, and Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, with the French
      ambassador. Then followed two esquires wearing the coronet of Normandy and
      Aquitaine, the lord-mayor with his mace and garter, several more knights
      and nobles. Close behind them was an open litter drawn by two white horses
      led by footmen dressed in white damask. In this litter sat the bright
      object of the parade in a jacket of silver tissue, mantle of the same
      lined with ermine, her dark hair falling in pretty contrast over her
      shoulders. A band of precious stones encircled her head, and above her was
      held by four knights on foot a canopy covered with cloth of cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master of the horse led the queen's own riding animal, bearing a rich
      side-saddle with trappings of cloth of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link393" id="link393">393</a></span>gold that reached nearly to the
      ground. Seven ladies on horseback, dressed in crimson velvet, followed;
      then came two chariots, in one of which sat the old Duchess of Norfolk
      with the Marchioness of Dorset, and in the other four ladies of the
      bed-chamber. Fourteen more ladies with their waiting maids came next, and
      the guard brought up the rear.

      At Fenchurch street was a pageant of children dressed up to represent
      different kinds of merchants, who welcomed the queen both in French and
      English, the whole procession halting for that purpose. At a corner of
      another street was an enormous fountain that poured forth fine Rhenish
      wine all day long, of which anybody could drink just as much as he chose.
      One of the pageants was a white falcon similar to the one on the barge,
      with this difference: it sat uncrowned amidst red and white roses, and
      when the queen came opposite it, an angel flew down, accompanied by soft
      music, and placed a crown of gold on its head. A fountain of red wine
      flowed at another corner, and the three Graces stood above it on a throne,
      before which sat a poet who recited verses and presented the queen with
      appropriate gifts from Faith, Hope and Charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city recorder handed the queen a purse containing a thousand marks in
      gold, which she graciously received with thanks. At Cheapside was a rich
      pageant from which proceeded music and singing, while Pallas, Venus, and
      Juno held up their apples of gold containing wisdom, riches, and felicity,
      which they presented to the queen. Over the gate of St. Paul's was a
      banner with this inscription in Latin: "Proceed, Queen Anne, and reign
      prosperously."
    </p>
    <p>
      On a scaffold near by were two hundred children, all beautifully dressed,
      who recited verses, and so after passing several other pageants and
      fountains of red and white wine, the queen arrived at Westminster. The
      palace was richly decorated within and without. She rode to the very
      middle of the hall, where she was assisted to alight from her litter, and
      led up the high dais, where she took her seat under the canopy of state.
      At her left side stood a cabinet with ten shelves filled with rich and
      costly cups and goblets of gold. After partaking of wine, cake, and sugar-plums,
      which were handed to her ladies also, she withdrew to change her dress,
      and probably to rest, for all the parading and sightseeing of the past
      several hours must have been rather fatiguing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was the one that Anne had looked forward to for many years;
      the one that was to place her on the throne of England. It was the 1st of
      July, and at a little after eight o'clock on that bright summer morning
      she stood under her canopy of state in a purple velvet mantle lined with
      ermine, a band of rubies encircling her brow. There was the usual
      procession for such occasions, and the queen was conducted to the high
      altar in Westminster Abbey, where she prostrated herself while Cranmer
      recited part of the service. Then he anointed her on the head and breast,
      placed the crown on her head, and handed her the sceptre, while the choir
      sang the Te Deum. She returned to her seat between the high altar and the
      choir, where she remained to the end of the mass, when her father led her
      to her private room off Westminster Hall to wait till the banquet was
      prepared. Then all the great earls stood in <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link395" id="link395">395</a></span>gorgeous attire prepared to wait
      on the queen in different capacities, the Duke of Suffolk as high steward,
      assisted by Lord William Howard, the Earl of Sussex as carver, the Earl of
      Arundel as chief butler, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was ready, the queen entered the hall with her canopy borne over
      her, washed her hands in the perfumed water poured over them by Sir Thomas
      Wyatt, and took her seat at the table, the Countesses of Oxford and
      Worcester standing on either side of her chair, while two gentlewomen sat
      at her feet. All the tables in the hall were beautifully laid and
      tastefully decorated, and there was music all through the meal. The king
      took no part in this ceremony at all, but remained shut up in the cloister
      of St. Stephen's a part of the abbey, whence he could overlook all the
      proceedings without being seen himself. During the dinner the Duke of
      Suffolk and Lord William Howard rode up and down the hall, laughing and
      chatting with the lords and ladies, and when it was over commanded them to
      remain in their places until the queen had washed her hands. She arose and
      stood in the middle of the hall, while the Earl of Sussex brought her some
      sweetmeats. Then the lord-mayor brought her a golden cup filled with wine.
      After she had drunk, she presented him the cup and walked towards the door
      of her room under her canopy. Before disappearing, she turned and
      presented the gold bells, canopy, and all its decorations to the barons
      who had carried it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day there were jousts before the king and queen in the
      tilt-yard. But the pope did not approve of this second marriage, and so
      expelled the royal couple from the church; and Henry's cousin Cardinal
      Pole, wrote him letters of reproach, calling Anne "Jezebel,"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorceress," and many other horrible names. Nevertheless, the king treated
      her with all the dignity of her station, and had <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link396" id="link396">396</a></span>her initial A joined with his
      own on all the gold and silver coins that were struck after their
      marriage. Henry VIII. was the first and last monarch of England who ever
      paid his wife that compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas More was one of Anne's special enemies, because he remained
      true in his friendship for Queen Katherine to the day of her death. When
      his daughter visited him in the Tower he asked her "how Queen Anne did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never better," she replied: "there is nothing else at court but dancing
      and sporting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never better!" said he, "alas! Meg, alas! it pitieth me to think into
      what misery, poor soul, she will shortly come. These dances of hers will
      prove such dances that she will spurn our heads off like foot-balls, but
      it will not be long ere her head will dance the like dance." Her tragical
      end proves the truth of that poet's prophetic words.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that great and good man was executed, the announcement of it was made
      to Henry while he happened to be playing cards with Anne. "Thou art the
      cause of this man's death," he cried, looking at her angrily, and rising
      from the table. He then shut himself up in his room, deeply grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1533.</span> In 1533 Anne had a little daughter
      born, who afterwards became the renowned Queen Elizabeth. The opposition
      her marriage had met with from Rome caused Anne to side with the
      Reformation party, though she always continued a Catholic at heart, and
      observed all the ceremonies of that church. It is probable that she took
      no part in the cruelty that Henry exercised over the pious reformers, but
      it is certain that she made no effort to prevent it; for had she done so,
      she was still powerful enough to have succeeded. She had enjoyed one
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably this change was due to the influence of the reformer, Hugh
      Latimer, whom she rescued from prison, where he had been sent by the
      bishop of London; for it was after he preached to her and pointed out her
      duty that she so generously distributed alms and even paid for the
      education of promising lads who were likely to devote themselves to the
      church. She must often have felt that <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link397" id="link397">397</a></span>after another, but when she
      reached the very summit of her greatness, no doubt she found that her path
      had been more thickly strewn with thorns than roses, and that in reading
      the Scriptures she felt the force of the text, which says: "What is a man
      profited if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" She became
      grave and serious, and spent more time at needlework with her ladies, whom
      she assisted in making clothing which she distributed among the poor.

      I am indeed a queen!" But it was not long before she was suffering all the
      bitter pangs that the good queen over whose death she rejoiced had
      endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had grown tired of her, and was carrying on a flirtation with the
      beautiful Jane Seymour, one of her attendants. And so, under one pretext
      or another, her friends were either beheaded or locked up in the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last her turn came, and just as she had finished her dinner, on the 2d
      of May, the Duke of Norfolk, with Cromwell and other lords of the council
      entered, while Sir William Kingston, lieutenant of the Tower, stood in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne asked "why they had come?" They replied: "That they came by the
      king's command to conduct her to the Tower, there to abide during his
      highness' pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be his majesty's pleasure I am ready to obey," she said, going with
      them to her barge without waiting to make the least change in her
      garments. Arriving at the Tower, she was placed in the apartment she had
      occupied on the night before her coronation. Her attendants were two
      enemies, who were particularly disagreeable to her&mdash;Lady Boleyn and
      Mrs. Cosyns. These two women never left her, night or day, for they slept
      on a pallet at the foot of her bed, and reported every word she uttered.
      They made all sorts of impertinent remarks to her, and kept constantly
      annoying her with questions by which they hoped to prove something against
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor queen was so affected by her close imprisonment that at times she
      seemed to have lost her reason. She wrote a touching letter to the king,
      appealing to his <span class="pagenum"><a name="link399" id="link399">399</a></span>mercy,
      but he took not the slightest notice of it, and just one week after she
      was sent to prison a charge of high treason was made by the grand jury of
      Westminster against Anne Boleyn, her brother, and four of her best
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends were condemned to death, as almost everybody was in Henry
      VIII.'s reign who was brought to trial for high treason, though sometimes
      they were not even tried at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-six "lords' triers," from the body of nobles in England were
      selected to try Lord Rochford, Anne's brother; and, although he defended
      himself with great spirit and eloquence, and many of the judges sided with
      him, he was found guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his removal, Anne, Queen of England, was called into court by an
      usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared immediately, and took her stand "with the true dignity of a
      queen, courtesying to her judges without any sign of fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      The charges were read, and she pleaded "Not guilty," but the trial was
      continued for a long time, and ended by a verdict of guilty. It was her
      uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, who presided at this trial, and he pronounced
      her sentence. She was condemned to be burnt or beheaded, at the king's
      pleasure. Anne Boleyn heard this dreadful doom without changing color, but
      when her stern kinsman had ended, she clasped her hands and raising her
      eyes to Heaven exclaimed: "O Father! O Creator! Thou who art the way the
      life, and the truth, knowest whether I have deserved this death."
    </p>
    <p>
      She then turned to her judges and proclaimed her innocence of every charge
      made against her, closing her remarks with: "Think not I say this in the
      hope of prolonging my life. God has taught me how to die, and he will
      strengthen my faith. As for my brother and those others who are unjustly
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="link400" id="link400">400</a></span>condemned,
      I would willingly suffer many deaths to deliver them; but since I see it
      so pleases the king I shall willingly accompany them to death, with this
      assurance, that I shall lead an endless life with them in peace." With a
      composed air, she rose, made a parting salutation to her judges, and left
      the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 19th of May was the day appointed for her execution, and the interval
      was passed in prayer and confession, receiving the sacraments of the
      church, and other preparations for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the king's pleasure that she should be beheaded in the grounds of
      the Tower, and that no strangers should be admitted. A headsman from
      Calais was brought over to do the horrible deed, because he was considered
      particularly expert. Anne Boleyn's fate had had no precedent in English
      history, for even in the Norman reigns of terror woman's life had been
      held sacred, and the most merciless of the Plantagenet sovereigns had been
      too manly to butcher ladies. But the age of chivalry was over, and Henry
      VIII. was the first sovereign who sent queens and princesses to the block,
      without justice or mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate queen was duly informed of her fate; her mournful
      experience had shown her the vanity and vexation of flattery. Beauty,
      wealth, genius, pleasure, power, royalty, had all been hers, and whither
      had they led her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not condescended to implore the mercy of the king, for she knew
      his pitiless nature too well even to attempt to touch his feelings. She
      passed the last night in prayer, and when morning came, and she heard that
      her execution was to be a few hours later than she expected, she said to
      Mr. Kingston: "I hear I shall not die afore noon, and I am very sorry, for
      I thought to be dead by this time, and past my pain," <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link401" id="link401">401</a></span>Mr. Kingston told her that the
      pain would be little and very short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard say," she replied, "that the executioner is very good, and I
      have a little neck," and she spanned it with her hands, laughing heartily
      as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1536.</span> Her last message to the king was:
      "Commend me to his majesty, and tell him he hath been ever constant in his
      career of advancing me; from a private gentlewoman he made me a
      marchioness, from a marchioness a queen, and now he hath left no higher
      degree of honor he gives my innocency the crown of martyrdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes before twelve o'clock the massive doors of the Tower were
      thrown open, and the royal victim appeared in a robe of black damask with
      a deep white cape falling around her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked very beautiful when she ascended the scaffold, with a calm and
      dignified air, and turning to Kingston she requested him not to hasten the
      signal of her death until she had spoken what she desired to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began: "Good Christian people, I am come hither to die by the
      law, therefore I will speak nothing against it. I am come hither to accuse
      no man, but only to die, and to yield myself humbly unto the will of my
      lord the king. I pray God to save the king, and send him long to reign
      over you, for a gentler or more merciful prince there never was. If any
      person will meddle with my cause, I require them to judge the best. Thus I
      take my leave of the world and of you, and I heartily desire that you all
      will pray for me." She then removed her hat and collar, as well as the
      close cap from her head, and handed them to her ladies, who were weeping
      so bitterly that they could not aid her. Then turning to them she said:
      "And ye, my damsels, who ever showed yourselves so diligent in my service,
      and who are now to be present at my last hour <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link402" id="link402">402</a></span>and mortal agony, as in good
      fortune ye were faithful to me, so even in this my miserable death ye do
      not forsake me. And as I cannot reward you for your true service to me, I
      pray you take comfort for my loss. Forget me not, and be always faithful
      to the king's grace, and to her whom with happier fortune, ye may have as
      your queen and mistress. Esteem your honor far above your life, and in
      prayers forget not to pray for my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Wyatt, the sister of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, who was one of
      Anne's devoted friends, attended her on the scaffold, and received her
      last gift, which was a little book of devotions bound in black enamel and
      gilt. She then whispered a few words to this lady, and kneeling down,
      placed her head upon the block. Time was allowed the poor unfortunate
      queen to say; "O Lord God, have pity on my soul," when the sword fell.
      With one stroke, the head of Anne Boleyn was severed from her body, and
      rolled in the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a black marble monument in the ancient church of
      Horndon-on-the-Hill, in Essex, pointed out as the burial place of Anne
      Boleyn, but as it bears no name, no notice or inscription of any kind,
      there is no proof that her body lies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great epic poet has beautifully said:&mdash;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

      CHAPTER XXIV. JANE SEYMOUR, THIRD QUEEN OF HENRY VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1536-1537.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ane Seymour has
      always been pronounced the most beautiful of all the wives of Henry VIII.
      But she has also been presented to the world as a meritorious, discreet,
      young woman. We cannot consider her so when we remember that within
      twenty-four hours after Anne Boleyn's head was cut off she became the
      king's wife. For it must have been while acting as maid of honor for that
      unhappy lady that she not only received the attentions of her fickle,
      heartless husband, but even made all the necessary arrangements for her
      marriage with him. We shudder at the thought of the preparations that must
      have been going forward for the wedding-feast at the palace, while the
      Tower was the scene of heart-rending agony to the queen, who was about to
      sacrifice her life for the gratification of a tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The giddiness of youth cannot be pleaded as apology for Jane Seymour's
      indecency, for she was no child when she permitted herself to be courted
      by the royal Bluebeard, and must have been entirely conscious of the
      enormity of her actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps her early education was at fault, but of that little is known
      excepting that it was acquired in France. She was maid of honor to Mary
      Tudor, queen of Louis XII., and went to England after her dismissal from
      the French court. Anne Boleyn occupied a similar position at the <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link404" id="link404">404</a></span>same time,
      therefore the two maids of honor probably knew each other intimately.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after Anne Boleyn had ascended the throne, she observed a locket
      that hung from a pretty gold chain about the neck of Jane Seymour, and
      expressed a desire to see it closer. The maid of honor blushed, faltered,
      and drew back, whereupon the queen snatched the locket from her, opened
      it, and beheld the likeness of the king, her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Anne Boleyn knew that her fate was sealed; she was
      indignant, but that availed her nothing. She found herself supplanted by a
      rival as she had supplanted her predecessor. Perhaps her punishment was
      deserved, but it does not justify the conduct of the king or his new
      lady-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1536.</span> When the axe made Henry VIII. a
      widower, Jane Seymour was at Wolf Hall, in Wiltshire, and her royal lover
      at Richmond Park. On the morning of the 19th of May his majesty stood
      under a spreading oak, with his huntsmen and hounds prepared for the
      chaise, awaiting the signal gun from the Tower to announce that he was
      free. At last the welcome sound reached his ear. "Ha, ha!" he cried, "the
      deed is done! uncouple the hounds and away." This was all the regret he
      expressed for the death of the woman he had pretended to love so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      His widowhood lasted just one night, for the next morning he was at Wolf
      Hall, where he was united to the beautiful Jane Seymour. The ceremony was
      performed in the parish church, and was succeeded by a feast at which
      several members of the king's privy council were present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the royal couple proceeded to Winchester, and from there to London. A
      grand reception was held on the 29th of May, when Jane was presented as
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When parliament met, a few days later, the lord-chan-

      cellor <span class="pagenum"><a name="link407" id="link407">407</a></span>made
      a lengthy speech setting forth the king's virtues, trying to justify his
      vagaries in the matrimonial line by a great deal of tedious, false
      reasoning, and winding up with the information that Anne Boleyn's daughter
      was not heir to the throne of England. Part of this speech was devoted to
      setting forth the noble sacrifices made by Henry VIII. for the benefit of
      his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker chosen by the House of Commons went further, and loaded the
      king with the most fulsome compliments, comparing him to Samson, Solomon,
      and Absalom combined. Thus was Henry VIII. encouraged in his wickedness,
      until, as Cardinal Wolsey wisely said: "he actually forgot that there was
      both heaven and hell."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Mary was on good terms with her stepmother, who effected a
      reconciliation between her and the king; but the conditions were so cruel,
      that there was not much to be grateful for. Perhaps Jane was not
      responsible for them, and as we have so little that is favorable to relate
      of this queen, we will give her the benefit of the doubt. She made no
      enemies, because she avoided expressing any decided opinions, and
      preserved as much as possible a placid silence, and permitted herself to
      be governed, in all things, by her husband. If regard for her head
      prompted such behavior, at least she was wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter of 1537 was a remarkably cold one, and the royal couple with
      their entire court crossed the frozen Thames on horseback, so thick and
      solid was the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's two other queens had been crowned, so he thought the same honor
      ought to be conferred on the third, but the continuance of the pestilence
      caused that ceremony to be postponed so long that death prevented it
      altogether, for Jane Seymour lived only eighteen months after her
      marriage. Meanwhile, she was living at Hampton Court, where her little son
      was born, who afterwards became Edward VI.

      Henry VIII. wrote a letter to Francis I. rejoicing over the birth of his
      son and expressing considerable regret at the death of his wife. He really
      did put on mourning attire, and appeared depressed in spirits for several
      weeks. This is all that could be expected of so worldly and gay a king.

      CHAPTER XXV. ANNE OF CLEVES, FOURTH QUEEN OF HENRY VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1516-1577.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nne of Cleves was
      a most unfortunate, ill-treated princess, but she possessed so many
      virtues that she surely deserved a better fate than to become the wife of
      a king so devoid of the feelings of a gentleman as Henry' VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the death of his third queen, this capricious monarch did not find
      it so easy to get another as he probably expected it would be. Certainly
      it must have been a woman of rare courage who would willingly subject
      herself to such a yoke, knowing the experience of his other victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Seymour had not been dead more than a month when he made a request of
      Francis I. that he might be permitted to choose a lady from the royal
      blood of France for his queen. That monarch replied, "that there was not a
      damsel of any degree in his own dominions who should not be at his
      disposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was quite flattered at this compliment, and thought it would only be
      necessary for him to put out his hand to secure any woman he might
      condescend to favor, so he requested Francis just to bring all the fairest
      ladies of his court to Calais for him to take his choice. The gallantry of
      the French king was shocked at such an idea, and he replied, "that it was
      impossible to bring ladies of noble blood to market as horses are trotted
      out at a fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Henry wanted to marry James V.'s lady-love, whom he had seen and
      admired, not paying the slightest attention to the fact that she was
      already engaged. When he found it impossible to get her, he was ready to
      consider the proposition of his ambassador with regard to her sister or
      Mademoiselle Vendôme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them be brought to Calais," he said, "and I will take a look at
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be impossible," was the reply; "but your majesty could send
      somebody to Paris to see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious! how can I depend upon any one but myself?" asked Henry. "I
      must see them, and hear them sing; and what is more, I must see how they
      look while they are singing," he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the year he found that there was no hope for him in France,
      so he put on a most melancholy air, and pretended to be dreadfully grieved
      at the death of his pretty Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of mind lasted for about two years; then Cromwell spoke in such
      flattering terms of the princesses of the house of Cleves that Henry began
      to think he had played the <i>rôle</i> of forlorn widower long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell had only seen Sybilla, the eldest daughter of the Duke of Cleves.
      She was married to the Duke of Saxony, and was famed for her talents,
      virtues, charming manners, and extreme beauty. But unfortunately for
      Henry, Anne, the second daughter, was as unlike her sister as possible,
      and had no accomplishments whatever, with the exception of needlework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holbein, the celebrated Dutch artist, was required to paint the portraits
      of both Anne and her younger sister, Amelia, for Henry's inspection, and
      Christopher Mount was sent to negotiate the treaty of marriage. He wrote a
      letter to Cromwell filled with Anne's praises and said, "she as far
      excelleth the Dutchess of Saxony as the golden sun excelleth the silver
      moon." <span class="pagenum"><a name="link411" id="link411">411</a></span>The
      Duke of Saxony was very much opposed to a union of his sister-in-law with
      a man of Henry VIII.'s character, but he was the champion of the
      Reformation, and Christopher Mount assured him "that the cause of
      Protestantism in Europe would be greatly advanced by the influence of a
      Lutheran Queen of England, for Henry was easily managed through his
      wives."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Cleves died in 1559, but his son, who succeeded him, favored
      Anne's marriage with King Henry, and so did their mother, both being
      strong allies of the Protestant cause, and feeling that even though it
      might be a sacrifice, it ought to be made for the sake of their religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Henry's commissioners wrote him that Anne "occupieth much of her
      time with her needle. She can read and write her own language, but French
      and Latin or other language she knoweth not; nor yet can sing or play on
      any instrument, for they take it here in Germany for a rebuke and an
      occasion of lightness that great ladies should be learned, or have any
      knowledge of music." He also speaks of her gentle and amiable temper, but
      above all he praises her sobriety, which is quite amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since the death of Jane Seymour the Catholics and Protestants of
      England had vied with each other as to which should be next represented in
      the queen. It was the magic brush of Hans Holbein that decided the
      question, and Cromwell won a triumph over Gardiner, Norfolk, and his other
      rivals, though it brought him ruin at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all matters of state policy and ceremony were arranged, and the
      young princess bade farewell to her mother, brother, and sisters, by whom
      she was tenderly beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first week in October, 1539, she left her native city, Dusseldorf on
      the Rhine, attended by a splendid escort. On her arrival at Antwerp she
      was received by the English <span class="pagenum"><a name="link412"
      id="link412">412</a></span>merchants there, who gave her a grand
      torchlight procession by daylight. Next day she proceeded on her journey,
      and arrived at Calais December 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a mile outside of the town she was met by a regiment of armed men,
      with the king's archers, all in gay attire, besides the Earl of
      Southampton, Lord William Howard, and many other lords and gentlemen.
      Gregory Cromwell, with twenty-four others wore coats of satin damask and
      velvet, with gold chains of great value, and two hundred yeoman who
      followed them were dressed in the king's colors, red and blue cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Southampton welcomed the royal bride and conducted her into
      Calais, where such a peal of guns was shot from the ships on her arrival
      that all her retinue were astonished. Then firing began all along the
      coast, and was continued by the vessels until there were one hundred and
      fifty rounds, and so much smoke that the people in Anne's train could
      scarcely see each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day she was presented by the mayor with a hundred gold
      sovereigns, and for about three weeks after her arrival there were all
      sorts of pastimes and festivities. Meanwhile Henry impatiently awaited his
      long-expected bride, and busied himself with the execution of four worthy
      abbots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind did not favor her progress until the 27th, when she embarked,
      attended by a fleet of fifty ships, and arrived at Deal the same day. The
      princess was received by a great company of ladies and gentlemen, and
      conducted to Dover Castle, where she remained until the next Monday, when,
      in a dreadful storm, she set out for Canterbury. Several days of travel
      brought the royal bride to Rochester, and New Year's Day was spent at the
      bishop's palace in that town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was so impatient to see her, that, in company <span
      class="pagenum"> <a name="link413" id="link413">413</a></span>with eight
      of his gentlemen-in-waiting, he rode to Rochester to steal a look at his
      German bride, who, no doubt he thought, would rival the bright-eyed Boleyn
      and the fair Seymour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival he sent a messenger to inform Anne "that he had brought her
      a New Year's gift, if she would please to receive it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed his messenger into the room where she sat, but a glance was
      sufficient to show him that he had been deceived. She was by no means a
      pretty woman, and Henry regarded himself as an injured person in having to
      marry her. Perhaps she was not more charmed with his appearance or
      manners, but she sank upon her knees at his approach and did her best to
      receive him lovingly. He raised her gently, and kissed her, but there
      could not have been much conversation between them so long as they had to
      employ an interpreter. Besides her language was so displeasing to his
      musical ear that he did not want to hear more of it than he could help,
      though he knew before she came that she could speak no English. The moment
      he left her presence he sent for the lords who had brought her over and
      made his complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Year's gift that he had provided for Anne was a muff and tippet of
      rich sable, but when he found she was not handsome he would not honor her
      by presenting it with his own hands, but sent it on the following morning
      by a messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to Greenwich in a melancholy frame of mind, and abused
      Cromwell for having provided him with a wife whom, with his usual
      brutality, he called a "great Flanders mare." Cromwell tried to put the
      blame on the Earl of Southampton, and said: "That when he found the
      princess so different from the pictures, and the reports that had been
      made of her, he ought to have stopped her <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link414" id="link414">414</a></span>at Calais till he had given the
      king notice that she was not so handsome as she had been represented." The
      admiral replied bluntly "that he was not invested with any such authority,
      his commission was to bring her to England, and he had obeyed orders." The
      king interrupted them by ordering them to find some means to get him out
      of his engagement. There was a great deal of discussion about the matter,
      but no objection to the marriage could be invented that would be at all
      satisfactory to Anne's relations in Germany, so Cromwell assured the king
      that as a matter of policy he must do nothing to gain the ill-will of her
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no remedy but that I must needs put my neck into this yoke?"
      exclaimed Henry, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these gracious words, which it is to be hoped did not reach the ears
      of the insulted lady who was waiting his orders at Dartford, he commanded
      the most splendid preparations to be made for his marriage. On the 3d of
      January a rich tent, covered with cloth of gold, was pitched at the foot
      of Shooter's Hill for the royal bride, and other tents around for her
      ladies. Twelve hundred gentlemen were ranged in double file from the park
      gates to the heath awaiting the arrival of the king with his bride. About
      twelve o'clock her grace came down from Shooter's Hill, accompanied by a
      hundred of her own nation, the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the
      Archbishop of Canterbury, with other bishops, lords and knights who had
      come from France, and went towards the tents, where Dr. Kaye, her almoner,
      presented all the officers and servants of her household, and addressed to
      her an eloquent Latin oration, of which she did not understand a word. It
      was answered by her brother's secretary, who acted as interpreter. Then
      Anne stepped out of her chariot, and was saluted and welcomed by
      sixty-five ladies, whom she thanked and kissed, after <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link415" id="link415">415</a></span>which all entered the tents to
      warm themselves, for the weather was exceedingly cold and disagreeable.
      When the king heard that his bride had arrived at her tent he set out
      through the park to meet her, accompanied by the officers of his council
      and his gentlemen in waiting, all richly attired in velvet coats
      embroidered in gold, and mounted on fine large horses. The Marquis of
      Dorset rode alone, attired in purple velvet and bearing the king's sword
      of state. Some distance behind him came Henry VIII., mounted on a splendid
      white courser with trappings of cloth of gold embroidered with pearls. All
      the buckles, bit, and pendants were of solid gold. The king wore an
      embroidered purple velvet coat, the sleeves and breast of which were
      slashed, showing cloth of gold beneath, and fastened together with large
      buttons of diamonds, rubies, and oriental pearls. His sword and girdle
      were studded with costly emeralds, and his cap was so covered with jewels
      that it was not possible to fix a value on it. Around his neck was a deep
      collar thickly studded with rubies and pearls.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bride was informed of Henry's approach she walked out of her
      tent, mounted a white horse, and, surrounded by her footmen, rode forward
      to meet him. Her dress was made of rich cloth of gold, cut round in Dutch
      fashion without a train. On her head she wore a close cap, above which was
      a circular bonnet ornamented with oriental pearls. Across her brow was a
      coronet of black velvet, and around her neck a band of superb diamonds.
      Henry saluted her in the most courteous manner, took off his hat and
      embraced her as though he really cared for her, while she, not forgetting
      her duty, and perhaps the instructions she had received, thanked him
      sweetly and praised the arrangements he had made for her reception. No
      doubt he was pleased with all the flattering remarks she <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link416" id="link416">416</a></span>felt obliged
      to make to him. Then he put her on his right side and they rode along
      together, he acting a deceitful part in trying to appear pleased, and she
      filled with indignation at the way he had scorned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the grand cavalcade that followed and preceded the royal pair arrived
      at Greenwich Castle all the men alighted from their horses excepting the
      king, who rode to the inner court with his bride. When the queen had
      alighted from her horse Henry tenderly embraced her, and bade her "welcome
      to her own," then conducted her through the hall that had been prepared
      for her reception. There he left her and went to his room, where he had an
      interview with Cromwell, to whom he made bitter complaints about the
      appearance of his unlucky bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cromwell said he was sorry his grace was not better satisfied, whereupon
      Henry bade him call his council together to see whether they could not hit
      upon some plan for getting him out of this marriage. The council met that
      very afternoon, but failed to aid the king out of his dilemma, and this
      put him in such a bad humor that he would not say what he had determined
      to do until the next Monday morning; then he ordered the marriage ceremony
      to be performed next day, without even consulting the bride..
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore a gown of cloth of gold, with raised silver flowers all over it.
      His coat was crimson satin embroidered and slashed, the points fastened
      with large diamonds, and a rich collar about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the presence-chamber, and calling Cromwell to him, said, "My
      lord, if it were not to satisfy the world and my realm, I would not do
      what I must do this day for any earthly thing." Then one of the officers
      of the household informed him that the queen was ready. He advanced
      towards her chamber door, but had to wait <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link417" id="link417">417</a></span>several minutes before she
      appeared, which made him very angry. Who can blame the poor woman for her
      tardiness? she would have been excusable if she had refused to come at
      all. At last Henry sent one of his lords to bring her. She was dressed in
      a robe of cloth of gold, thickly embroidered in large flowers of oriental
      pearls. The skirt was cut, as before, round without a train, and at her
      neck and waist were costly jewels. Her hair fell luxuriantly over her
      shoulders, and on her head was a coronet of diamonds, with a few sprigs of
      rosemary. She walked modestly forward, between the Earls of Overstein and
      Essex, with a sad, demure expression, and on approaching the spot where
      the king stood made three low obeisances. She was followed by her ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archbishop of Canterbury and Cranmer performed the marriage ceremony,
      the Earl of Overstein gave her away, and on her wedding-ring was engraved
      this sentence "God send me weel to keepe."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 4th of February the king and queen went up the Thames in grand
      state to their palace of Westminster. Henry kept up an outward show of
      attention to his bride, but she knew not the art of pleasing, felt no
      sympathy with his tastes, and could not gain his affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew this, but could not help it. Several times she sent for Cromwell,
      hoping with his advice to be more successful, but he positively refused to
      talk privately with her. He had reasons of his own for doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of May a company of the gallant knights at court, all dressed
      in white velvet with rich ornaments, had a grand tournament in honor of
      the recent marriage, and this was the last time Henry and Anne of Cleves
      ever appeared together in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne studied the English language industriously, and tried in every
      possible manner to please her lord, but by <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link418" id="link418">418</a></span>the end of five months she was
      convinced that it was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a low-born, unprincipled creature at court, named Sir Thomas
      Wriothesley, who would have done or said anything to gain favor with his
      sovereign, and he kept constantly lamenting over Henry's position, and how
      hard it was for him to be bound to a wife whom he could not love. In this
      way he prepared the way for a divorce, and Henry was only too ready to
      avail himself of any excuse. Now his sensitive conscience began to trouble
      him again. This time it was on the score of religion; he could not bear to
      think of having a Lutheran wife. No wonder poor Anne lost patience, and in
      a moment of pique, told him that, "if she had not been compelled to marry
      him she might have fulfilled her engagement with another to whom she had
      promised her hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for him; she could scarcely have said anything that would
      have suited him better, and he at once set to work to make her position as
      unpleasant as possible. His first move was to dismiss all her foreign
      attendants, and supply their places with English ladies of his own
      selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time he was in love with the young and beautiful Katharine Howard,
      niece to the Duke of Norfolk, and had decided to make her his wife as soon
      as he could manage it. The leaders of the Catholic party favored this
      union, and hoped at the same time for the downfall of their great enemy,
      Cromwell. They were soon to be gratified, for Henry now required a tool,
      who would not be guided by the nice feelings of a gentleman, for carrying
      out his plans. Cromwell was not such a one, and he must be put out of the
      way. In this reign of terror nothing was easier, and in less than a month
      he was arrested and shut up in the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later Anne was sent to Richmond under pretence <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link419" id="link419">419</a></span>that her
      health required change of air, and this was the prelude to the divorce for
      which Henry had now grown impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archbishop Cranmer had performed the marriage ceremony, and it now became
      his duty to divorce the king for the third time in less than seven years.
      This was accomplished by unanimous consent of the clergy July 13. As the
      queen was a stranger to English laws and customs, she was spared the
      humiliation of appearing before the council.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everything was settled, Suffolk, Southampton, and Wriothesley were
      appointed to go to Richmond to get the queen's consent. She was so alarmed
      when she saw them that before the true object of their visit could be
      explained to her she fell fainting to the ground. No doubt the poor woman
      thought she was on the point of having her head cut off. When she
      recovered consciousness, she was told that if she would resign her title
      as queen Henry would adopt her for a sister, and that she should be
      endowed with estates to the value of £3,000 a year. This was an immense
      relief, and Anne expressed her willingness to resign her honors with such
      alacrity that the lords were quite surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry heard this, and saw the paper she had signed to that effect, he
      could not believe that she was so ready to part with so supremely precious
      a person. Fearing that she might relent, he wrote to his council
      requesting them to have her write a letter to her brother explaining her
      position, and expressing her earnest desire for the divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne then wrote her mother and brother that she was honorably treated, and
      felt quite cheerful and contented. She hoped that no dispute would arise
      between her native land and England, where she purposed spending her life,
      and begged them in no way to interfere, no doubt dreading that if they did
      so it would be visited on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Anne passed her time very pleasantly at Richmond, dressed
      magnificently, and performed many deeds of charity; in short, she was
      happier than she had been since her departure from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixteen months later Katharine was thrown into prison, and then several
      attempts were made by various parties to bring about the reunion of Henry
      and Anne, but fortunately for her without success. From her retirement she
      heard

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1540.</span> On the 28th of July, Cromwell was
      beheaded, and the pious, learned Doctor Barnes, who had been instrumental
      in bringing about the marriage, was burned at the stake.<span

      In August Henry visited his divorced wife at Richmond, and was so well
      received by her that he stayed to supper and seemed in excellent humor.

      queen. <span class="pagenum"><a name="link421" id="link421">421</a></span>of

      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine Howard enjoyed sixteen months of boundless influence over her
      husband, but her lucky star was soon to wane, and without being allowed to
      open her lips in her own defence save to her confessor, she walked like a
      sheep to the slaughter. Her execution took place February 13.

      CHAPTER XXVI. KATHARINE HOWARD, FIFTH QUEEN OF HENRY VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (A.D. 1521-1542.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is not a
      family in England whose name has appeared so often in its history, whether
      for good or for bad, as that of the Howards, nor one whose members filled
      such varied and important positions, as every attentive reader will admit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine Howard was nearly related to Anne Boleyn; she became the fifth
      wife of Henry VIII., and is by no means one of the nobler specimens of the
      family to which she belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was born in 1521, and had the misfortune to lose her mother while she
      was still young. Her father's duties called him from home a greater part
      of the time, and the Duchess of Norfolk, her grandmother, who had charge
      of Katharine, was so neglectful of her duty as to permit the child to
      choose her own companions, and they were unfortunately low and degraded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike most grandmothers, the duchess merely tolerated Katharine in her
      household, and felt that she had performed her part when the little maid
      was locked in her room, and the key safely deposited in her own pocket.
      But, like many naughty girls, Katharine managed, in spite of locks, to
      meet Francis Derham, one of the Duke of Norfolk's retainers, to whom she
      secretly engaged herself. In order to be nearer his lady-love, Derham
      entered the service of her grandmother as gentleman-usher. After a <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link423" id="link423">423</a></span>time the old
      lady began to observe certain signs of intimacy between this pair of
      lovers, and on entering a room one day unexpectedly she found them romping
      together. Shocked at the familiarity of her usher towards her
      granddaughter, she boxed the ears of the lady-attendant for permitting it,
      punished Katharine, and dismissed Derham from her service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0121" id="linkimage-0121"> </a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0427.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      After that Katharine was kept under greater restraint, and as she grew
      into womanhood learned to behave properly, and became remarkable for her
      charming and graceful manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met Henry VIII. the first time at a banquet given by the Bishop of
      Winchester to celebrate the monarch's marriage with Anne of Cleves, and
      afterwards at the house of Gardiner. The king took such a fancy to her
      that it was not long before he secured her appointment as maid-of-honor to
      the queen. It has been supposed that Katharine was instrumental in
      bringing about the death of <span class="pagenum"><a name="link424"
      id="link424">424</a></span>Cromwell, but, as she only intrigued for the
      king's favors, it is not probable that she troubled her head about
      politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry VIII. fell in love with her as he had done with Anne Boleyn and Jane
      Seymour, when they were maids-of-honor, and little Katharine was silly
      enough to be flattered by the marks of favor he showed her. The Duchess of
      Norfolk, instead of warning the girl of her danger, was foolish enough to
      encourage her to court the king's attention, and provided her with fine
      clothes to make her as attractive as possible to his majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was easily won, and privately married Katharine a few days after he
      was divorced from Anne of Cleves.

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1540.</span> On the 8th of August, 1540, the new
      bride was introduced at Hampton Court as Queen of England. A short
      honeymoon was passed at Windsor, and then the royal couple made a tour
      through several counties, but the king had exhausted his treasury when he
      married his Flemish bride, so he could not honor Katharine Howard with
      either a coronation or a marriage festival. But he was very much in love,
      and lavished affection on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months of peace and happiness were enjoyed by the royal couple, Henry
      seldom leaving the side of his young wife, nor permitting any of his
      councillors to interrupt his pleasures. Katharine felt her power and
      forgot what had been the fate of her predecessors. She was soon to be
      reminded, however, for the realm had become divided into two parties&mdash;the
      Catholic and Protestant, and both were strong. The Reformers fondly hoped
      that Anne of Cleves might be restored to her former position, and regarded
      Katharine in the same unfavorable light as Anne Boleyn had been looked
      upon by the Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in the spring, came a crisis in the shape of an insurrection by
      the Catholics in Yorkshire, headed by Sir <span class="pagenum"><a

      Neville. Henry thought Cardinal Pole was the cause of it, and so took his
      revenge by ordering the execution of the Countess of Salisbury, Pole's
      mother, who had been in the tower for more than a year: when the aged lady
      heard of it she refused to lay her head upon the block, saying, 'so should
      traitors do, but I am none, and if you will have my head you must win it
      as you can.' thereupon the brutal ruffian who acted as executioner dragged
      her by her hoary locks, and 'slovenly butchered the woman in whose veins
      flowed the noblest blood of England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of ascertaining the exact state of affairs in Yorkshire,
      King Henry set out with his wife for that place early in July, 1541,
      leaving Cranmer, Audley, and Seymour, three Protestant adherents, among
      his councillors at home. At Yorkshire the royal couple were met by two
      hundred gentlemen in velvet coats, with four thousand yeomen, who knelt
      while one of their number offered nine hundred pounds. At another place
      three hundred ecclesiastics presented six hundred pounds, and so on until
      Henry found himself much richer than when he started on his journey. Queen
      Katharine saw more of the pomp of royalty at this time than she had done
      during the whole year before, for the wealthy aristocracy in every part of
      the country vied with each other in the grandeur of their entertainments
      given in honor of the royal couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine had been married little more than a year when Francis Derham
      returned to England, and she committed the error of appointing him as her
      private secretary. As soon as the king heard of the relation that had
      existed between this man and his wife previous to her marriage his
      jealousy was aroused, and the Protestant statesmen took good care to
      encourage every suspicion that entered their monarch's head. Meanwhile
      poor little Katharine was <span class="pagenum"><a name="link428"
      id="link428">428</a></span>entirely unconscious of the storm that was
      gathering about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Henry was soon forced to order her removal from Hampton Court.
      Wriothesley and Rich were the unprincipled, cruel agents who, determined
      upon the destruction of the queen, persecuted her until she was beside
      herself with terror and grief. Then, too, she loved her husband, and when
      she was compelled to leave him without one word of farewell, one look of
      compassion, her heart was almost broken. The king suffered also, but his
      council took little heed of that; it would be dangerous for them were
      Katharine to regain her power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare truly says:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      "Trifles, light as air,

    <p class="indent15">
      Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As proofs of holy writ."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine was removed to Sion House, and thence a few days later to the
      gloomy dungeon of the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the short season of terror that succeeded the queen's arrest,
      Derham, the poor old Duchess of Norfolk, Culpepper, Katharine's cousin,
      and several other persons who were guilty of no crime but that of
      suspecting the attachment that had existed before her marriage between
      Katharine and Derham, were executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 16th of January, 1542, parliament met to decide the fate of the
      queen, and without granting her the privilege of uttering one word in her
      own defence she was condemned to die. The 14th of the following month was
      fixed upon for the execution of this beautiful young girl, against whom no
      crime could be proved even through the instrumentality of the torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1542.</span> She met her death calmly and meekly,
      professing to the last her loyalty to the king. Her burial <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link429" id="link429">429</a></span>took place
      immediately without even the ceremonies that would have been accorded to
      the meanest of her subjects; she was interred in St. Peter's chapel of the
      Tower. When speaking of Henry VIII., Sir Walter Raleigh says: "If all the
      patterns of a merciless tyrant had been lost to the world they might have
      been found in this prince."

      CHAPTER XXVII. KATHARINE PARR, SIXTH QUEEN OF HENRY VIII.
    </h2>

      (A.D. 1513-1548.)
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>atharine Parr was
      the first Protestant Queen of England, and the only one of the wives of
      Henry VIII. who supported the doctrine of the Reformation with sincerity.
      She was an Englishwoman, but not of royal birth, being the only daughter
      of Sir Thomas Parr, a knight. She was gifted by nature with a fine mind,
      which was carefully cultivated by her excellent mother, as some of her
      writings that still exist certainly prove. She read and wrote Latin well,
      and had some knowledge of Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a little girl she never could bear to sew, and often said to her
      mother, "my hands are ordained to touch crowns and sceptres, not spindles
      and needles." But Lady Parr was too wise to allow such notions to take a
      strong hold of her daughter's mind, and insisted on her performing those
      duties that befitted her station in life; consequently her embroidery, of
      which specimens have been preserved, shows unusual skill and industry. At
      Lizergh Castle a magnificent counterpane and toilet-cover are exhibited as
      the work of her hands, and although three centuries have passed since it
      was done, the colors are scarcely dimmed at all. The material is the
      richest white satin. In the centre is a medallion of a raised eagle
      beneath the royal crown, surrounded by a wreath of flowers in colored
      silks and gold thread. At each corner is a large dragon in purple,
      crimson, and gold, while bouquets of

      in gorgeous colors are dispersed here and there over the other part. The
      pieces match, but are of different proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katharine was married twice before she became the wife of Henry VIII. Her
      first husband was Lord Edward Borough, a middle-aged widower with several
      children, who died a short time after the marriage. John Neville, Lord
      Latimer, was her second choice; he was also a widower with children, and
      Katharine's amiable temper and sound sense so well fitted her to perform
      the duties a stepmother that she was loved and esteemed by the families of
      both her husbands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not more than twenty-nine years old when she was left a widow for
      the second time. It was then that she became a convert to the Reformed
      religion, and encouraged its apostles to meet daily in her chamber of
      state to preach their sermons.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not only pious, learned and handsome, but she possessed great
      wealth, and was connected by descent or marriage with some of the noblest
      families in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely six months had elapsed after the death of Lord Latimer when she
      was informed by Henry VIII. that she was the lady whom he intended to
      honor by making her his sixth wife. She was amazed, and no doubt
      terrified, when she recalled the cruel treatment of her royal suitor's
      other victims'. Besides Lord Seymour was courting her, and she had favored
      his attentions. But that gentleman valued his head so much that no sooner
      did he hear of his all-powerful royal brother-in-law's intention than he
      vanished from the scene, leaving Katharine to transfer her affection as
      best she might.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1543.</span> She exchanged her widow's weeds for
      bridal robes, and was married at Hampton Court without pageantry, but with
      all suitable observance of ceremony. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link434" id="link434">434</a></span>We are reminded of the fair
      Scheherazade in the Arabian Nights, who married the sultan, knowing that
      it was his custom to take a fresh wife every day and cut off her head in
      the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cross, selfish old tyrant whom Katharine Parr had the courage to
      marry was in such bad health that he needed a skilful nurse; perhaps for
      that reason she felt confident that her position would be secure. On the
      day of her marriage she gave presents of bracelets set with rubies, as
      well as a liberal sum of money, to the Princesses Mary and Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The University of Cambridge sent the king a congratulatory letter on his
      choice of a Protestant wife, and the celebrated Roger Ascham corresponded
      with her in the name of that college, requesting her to write oftener, and
      not to shrink from being called learned. The dignity of the scholar and
      the queen are beautifully blended with the tenderness of the woman in the
      character of Katharine Parr after she ascended the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became an object of jealous ill-will to Gardiner, the leader of the
      Catholic party, who feared her influence over the king. Scarcely two weeks
      after the marriage he advised Henry to appoint a commission to search
      every house in Windsor for books written in favor of the new religion.
      Henry consented, but made an exception of the castle, no doubt having
      reason to know that more of such works would be found hidden away in his
      own household than in all the town put together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was that many men and women were arrested, tried, and condemned
      to death, and although the flames of their martyrdom were kindled almost
      in sight of the Protestant queen, she was unable to save the victims. She
      knew well enough that the murder of these humble Reformers was a blow
      aimed at herself, and that Gardiner was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link435" id="link435">435</a></span>playing a bold game against all
      those professing her religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first acts of justice that Katharine performed after she became
      queen was to restore the king's two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, to
      their proper position at court, after which she was constantly making them
      presents, and showing them many deeds of tenderness and motherly care. She
      and Mary were opposed to each other in religious belief, but they were
      about the same age, had the same accomplishments and tastes, and soon
      became warm and steadfast friends. Elizabeth's brilliant talents were
      drawn forth and encouraged by her gifted stepmother, who also directed the
      studies of Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of his letters to her he says: "I thank you, most noble and
      excellent queen, for the letters you have lately sent me; not only for
      their beauty, but for their imagination. When I see your good writing and
      the excellence of your genius, quite surpassing my invention, I am sick of
      writing. But then I think how kind your nature is, and that whatever
      proceeds from a good, kind intention will be acceptable; and so I write
      you this letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her celebrated work, "The Lamentations of a Sinner," is one of the finest
      specimens of English composition of that period. It is a treatise on
      morality and the imperfections of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry would have been miserable with a woman of such superior intellect if
      she had not constantly flattered him and studied his various moods. But so
      great was the influence she acquired over him, and the confidence he felt
      in her wisdom, that when he went on an expedition against France he
      appointed her to govern his realm as Queen Regent of England and Ireland,
      assisted by the Earl of Hertford.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his absence he wrote very loving letters to his <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link436" id="link436">436</a></span>wife, who,
      together with her royal step-children, resided in one house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1544.</span> She showed a great deal of moral
      courage, but by her beauty, tact, and domestic virtues she had made
      herself so necessary to her fat, dropsical husband that she was dearer to
      him than any of her predecessors had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had become so unwieldy from disease that he could not move without
      assistance, and his wife showed herself the most patient and tender of
      nurses. Sometimes she would remain on her knees for hours bathing and
      bandaging his ulcerated leg, for he would not permit anybody to touch it
      but her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1546.</span> The last occasion of festivity at the
      court of Henry VIII. was when ambassadors arrived to arrange terms of
      peace between France and England. They were met by a numerous cavalcade of
      nobles, knights and gentlemen, headed by the young heir to the throne,
      Prince Edward, who, though only in his ninth year, was mounted on a
      charger, and welcomed them in the most graceful and engaging manner. He
      conducted them to Hampton Court, where for ten day's they were feasted and
      entertained with great magnificence by the king and queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry presented Katharine with jewels of great value, that she might make
      a good appearance before their French guests, he also provided new and
      costly hangings and furniture for her apartments as well as a quantity of
      handsome silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wriothesley and Bishop Gardiner were alarmed at Katharine's
      ever-increasing influence, not only over her husband, but over the mind of
      young Edward as well, and watched her closely, in the hope that they might
      be able to make some charge against her. Nothing offered itself excepting
      her religious opinions, which were opposed to Henry's.

      persons were burned to death about this time for professing the reformed
      doctrine, among whom was the young, beautiful and learned Anne Askew. She
      was a lady of honorable birth, who became a convert to the new faith, and
      was for that reason violently driven from her home by her cruel husband.
      Resuming her maiden name, she worked hard for her religion, and was aided
      by the first ladies at court. When it was discovered that she had sent
      books to the queen, she was singled out as a victim by those who hoped by
      means of torture to wring some confession from her by which Katharine
      might be charged with heresy or treason. But they were mistaken, for the
      heroic Anne Askew died at the stake like a true martyr, "with an angelic
      expression on her smiling countenance." Sir George Blagge was arrested
      also, but he happened to be one of the king's prime favorites, and was
      sometimes called by the endearing nickname of "pig." As soon as Henry
      heard of this arrest he sent for Wriothesley and rated him well,
      commanding him to draw up a pardon on the spot. On his release Blagge flew
      to thank his preserver, who on seeing him cried out, "Ah! my pig, are you
      here safe again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire," was the reply, "and if your majesty had not been better than
      your bishops your pig had been roasted ere this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next attack was on the queen herself, whom Wriothesley and Gardiner
      had resolved to strike with a fatal blow. They told the king that her
      sister, Lady Herbert, not only read the books that he had prohibited, but
      also gave them to Katharine to read. Now it happened that the royal couple
      often conversed on theological subjects in their hours of domestic
      privacy, and Henry enjoyed his wife's ready wit and eloquence. She courted
      these subjects, because, knowing that he was suffering from an incurable
      malady, she felt it her duty to turn his mind heavenward. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link440" id="link440">440</a></span>One day in
      the presence of Gardiner she went a little too far in opposing her lord's
      views, and as he was suffering with his leg he felt rather more irritable
      than usual. He therefore snappishly put a stop to the discussion; after
      making a few pleasant remarks Katharine left the room. "A good hearing it
      is," said Henry sharply, "when women become such clerks; and much to my
      comfort to come, in mine old age, to be taught by my wife!" Gardiner took
      advantage of the king's wounded vanity to insinuate things against his
      wife that he would not have dared to say a few days before. He flattered
      him on his knowledge of theology, and declared that his majesty excelled
      the princes of that age and every other, as well as all the professed
      doctors of divinity, so much that it was absurd for anybody to think of
      arguing with him as the queen had just done. He added that it was painful
      for any of his counsellors to hear it, because those who were so bold in
      words would not hesitate to commit any act of disobedience. In fact he so
      poisoned the king's mind as to gain from him a warrant to consult with
      others of his party about drawing up articles against the queen that might
      bring her head to the block. But they decided to begin with the ladies of
      the court whom she esteemed most, and to search their trunks and closets
      for something to charge Katharine with, and after they had found it to
      arrest her in the middle of the night and take her in a barge to the
      Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the queen suspected nothing, but continued her nursing of
      her husband and her religious discussions with him as before. One day an
      attendant of Katharine's picked up a paper in the gallery of Whitehall
      that Wriothesley had dropped. It contained a list of charges against the
      queen with an order for her arrest, and bore Henry's signature. The
      terrified woman had an attack of hysterics as soon as she became
      acquainted with the contents of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="link441"
      id="link441">441</a></span>paper; as her apartment was next to the king's
      he heard her shrieks and cries, and sent to inquire what was the matter.
      Her doctor informed the messenger that the queen was seriously ill, and
      that the cause seemed to be distress of mind. No doubt Henry realized how
      much he should miss her gentle nursing if she should die, so he determined
      to pay her a visit. Accordingly he was wheeled into her room in a chair,
      and was really alarmed when he saw how ill she looked. After a few minutes
      she assured him that his visit had greatly revived her, and at the same
      time expressed her regret at having seen so little of him for a few days,
      and her fears that she had unintentionally given him some cause for
      offence. Henry replied kindly and affectionately. Then she was so humble
      and loving in her manner that a reaction took place in the humor of her
      imperious lord, and he told the physician of the plot against the
      patient's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Katharine felt well enough to return the king's visit.
      She entered his room, attended by her sister, Lady Herbert, and the king's
      young niece, Lady Jane Grey, who carried the candles before her majesty.
      Henry welcomed her courteously, but in course of time tried to draw her
      into a religious argument as usual. She avoided the snare by observing,
      "that she was but a woman, with all the imperfections natural to the
      weakness of her sex, therefore in all matters of doubt and difficulty she
      must refer herself to his majesty's better judgment; for," she continued,
      "God hath appointed you supreme head of us all, and of you, next unto God,
      will I ever learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, by St. Mary!" cried the king, "ye are become a doctor, Kate, to
      instruct us, and not to be instructed of us, as oftentime we have seen."
    </p>

      "Indeed," replied she, "if your majesty have so conceived <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="link442" id="link442">442</a></span>my meaning
      has been mistaken, for I have always held it preposterous for a woman to
      instruct her lord; and if I have ever presumed to differ with your
      highness on religion it was partly to gain information for my own comfort
      regarding certain nice points on which I stood in doubt, and sometimes
      because I perceived that in talking you were better able to pass away the
      pain and weariness of your present infirmity, which encouraged me to this
      boldness, in the hope of profiting by your majesty's learned discourse."

      There was no limit to the flattery that this egotist could stand. With a
      complacent smile he replied, "And is it so, sweetheart? Then we are
      perfect friends." He then kissed her, and gave her leave to depart.

      On the day appointed for her arrest the king felt better, and sent for her
      to take the air with him in the garden. She came attended by three ladies.
      Presently Wriothesley with forty armed men entered the garden with the
      intention of carrying the queen off to the Tower. But he had not been
      informed of the change in the king's mind. To his great surprise Henry
      received him with a burst of indignation, calling him beast, fool, and
      knave, and bidding him get out of his sight. Katharine tried to calm him,
      and begged forgiveness for her foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! poor soul," said the king, "thou little knowest, Kate, how evil he
      deserveth this grace at thy hands. On my word, sweetheart, he hath been to
      thee a very knave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if Katharine had not been a woman of forbearance and real virtue she
      would immediately have turned on her enemies when she had the king in her
      power, but instead of that she induced him to overlook Wriothesley's
      offence, but he never forgave Gardiner the blunder he had made, and not
      only struck his name from his council-book but forbade him his presence.
      Henry is said to have been very kind <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="link443" id="link443">443</a></span>and affectionate to Katharine
      during his latter days, yet it was well-known that he was preparing
      another charge of heresy against her when death overtook him, and that she
      survived him only by special good luck.

    <p>
      <span class="side">A.D. 1547.</span> Henry VIII. expired January 28, 1547,
      at the royal palace of Westminster, in the fifty-sixth year of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his will was opened Katharine was surprised and indignant to find
      that she was not appointed regent of the realm, with the care of the young
      King Edward VI., as she deserved to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king's body lay in state for several days, and was then buried with
      great pomp in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months after his death Katharine returned to her former lover, Sir
      Thomas Seymour, to whom she was married in the month of May, 1547. Her
      royal stepchildren were much pleased at this match, and continued their
      affection for Katharine throughout her life.
